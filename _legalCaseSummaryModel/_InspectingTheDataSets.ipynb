      "in that context,it was held: \"the question is whether the tenant or a sub-tenant is a person interested and is entitled to notice. it is obvious that u/s.105 of transfer of property act,a lease creates right or an interest in enjoyment of the demised property and a tenant or a sub-tenant is entitled to remain in possession of the demised property until the lease is duly terminated and eviction takes place in accordance with law. therefore,a tenant or a sub-tenant in possession of a tenement in the town planning scheme is a person interested within the meaning of rules 21(3) and (4) of the rules. but he must be in possession of the property on the crucial date i.e.when. the town planning scheme is notified in the official gazette. every owner or tenant or a sub-tenant,in possession on that date alone shall be entitled to a notice and opportunity.\n",

      "The assessee company is an investment company deriving its income from properties in the city of Bombay.\n",
      "For the assessment year 1940 41 the net income of the assessee under the head \"property\" was computed by the Income tax Officer in the sum of Rs. 6,21,764 after deducting from gross rents certain payments.\n",
      "The company had paid during the relevant year Rs. 1,22,675 as municipal property tax and Rs. 32,760 as urban property tax.\n",
      "Deduction of these two sums was claimed under the provisions of section 9 the Act.\n",
      "Out of the first item a deduction in the sum of Rs. 48,572 was allowed on the ground that this item represented tenants ' burdens paid by the assessee, otherwise the claim was disal lowed.\n",
      "The, appeals of the assessee to the Appellate As sistant Commissioner and to the Income tax Appellate Tribu nal were unsuccessful.\n",
      "The Tribunal, however, agreed to refer two questions of law to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, namely, (1) Whether the municipal taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under 555 the provisions of section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act; (2) Whether the urban immoveable property taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under section 9 (1) (iv) or under section 9 (1) (v) of the Indian Income tax Act.\n",
      "A supplementary reference was made covering a third question which was not raised before us and it is not there fore necessary to refer to it.\n",
      "The High Court answered all the three questions in the negative and hence this appeal.\n",
      "The question for our determination is whether the munic ipal property tax and urban immoveable property tax can be deducted as an allowance under clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act.\n",
      "The decision of the point depends firstly on the construction of the language employed in sub clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act, and secondly, on a finding as to the true nature and character of the liability of the owner under the relevant Bombay Acts for the payment of these taxes.\n",
      "Section 9 along with the relevant clause runs thus: (1) The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head ' income from property ' in respect of the bona fide annual value of property consisting of any buildings or lands appurtenant thereto of Which he is the owner, . . subject to the following allowances, namely : (iv) where the property is subject to a mortgage or other capital charge, the amount of any interest on such mortgage or charge; where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the. amount of such charge; where the property is subject to a ground rent, the amount of such ground rent; and, where the property has been acquired, constructed, repaired, renewed or recon structed with borrowed capital, the amount of any interest payable on such capital; . . . \" It will be seen that clause (iv) consists of four sub clauses corresponding to the four deductions allowed 556 under the clause.\n",
      "Before the amending Act of 1939, clause (iv) contained only the first, third and fourth sub clauses.\n",
      "Under the first sub clause interest is deductible whether the amount borrowed on the security of the property was spent on the property or not.\n",
      "There is no question of any capital or other expenditure on the property.\n",
      "The expression \"capital charge\" in the sub clause cannot connote a charge on the capital, that is, the property assessed.\n",
      "That would be a redundancy as the opening words themselves clearly indicate that the charge is on the property.\n",
      "We are therefore of opinion that capital charge here could only mean a charge created for a capital sum, i.e., a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.\n",

      "It was not an assessment under section 9 but an assess ment on the general income of an assessee who was liable to pay maintenance for his step mother which had been charged on all his assets by a decree of Court.\n",
      "It was not a li ability voluntarily incurred by him but one cast on him by law.\n",
      "The Privy Council held that the amount paid by him in discharge of that liability formed no part of his real income and so should not be included in his assessment.\n",
      "Though the decision proceeded on the principle that the outgoings were not part of the assessee 's income at all, the framers of the amending Act of 1939 wanted, apparently, to extend the principle, so far as the assessment of property was concerned, even to cases where obligatory payments had to be made out of the assessee 's income from the property charged with such payments, and the second sub clause, namely, \"where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the amount of such charge\" was added.\n",
      "It is this sub clause which the appellant invokes in support of its claim to deduction of the municipal and urban, property taxes in the present case.\n",

      "557 be understood in the same sense as in sub clause (1); that is to say, the first sub clause having provided for deduc tion of interest where a capital sum is charged on the property, this sub clause provides for a deduction of annual sums so charged, such sums not being capital sums, the limiting words being intended to exclude cases where capital raised on the security of the property is made repayable in instalments.\n",
      "In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji (1), a Bench of the Bombay High Court considered the meaning of these words.\n",
      "As regards \"annual charge,\" Beau mont C.J. observed as follows : \"The words, I think, would cover a charge to secure an annual liability.\" Kania J., as he then was, said as follows : \"I do not see how a charge can be annual unless it means a charge in respect of a payment to be made annually.\" This construction of the words has been followed in the judgment under appeal.\n",
      "In Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Income tax (2) (the connected appeal before us), the Bench of the Allahabad High Court agreed with the construction placed on these words in the Bombay case, i.e., the words \"annual charge\" mean a charge to secure an annual liability.\n",
      "It is therefore clear that there is no conflict of judicial deci sions as to the meaning of the phrase \"annual charge\" occur ring in section 3 (1) (iv) and the meaning given is the natural meaning of these words.\n",
      "As to the phrase \"capital charge\", Beaumont C.J. in the case above referred to took the view that the words mean a charge on capital.\n",
      "Kania J., however, took a different view and observed that he was not prepared to accept the sugges tion that a document which provides for a certain payment to be made monthly or annually and charged on immoveable property or the estate of an individual becomes a capital charge.\n",

      "558 words were considered as not meaning a charge on capital.\n",
      "It was said that if an annual charge means a charge to secure the discharge of an annual liability, then, capital charge means a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.\n",
      "We think this construction is a natu ral construction of the section and is right.\n",
      "The determination of the point whether the taxes in dispute fall within the ambit of the phrase \"annual charge not being a capital charge\" depends on the provisions of the statutes under which they are levied.\n",

      "The primary responsibility to pay this property tax is on the lessor (vide section 146 of the Act).\n",
      "In order to assess the tax provision has been made for the determination of the annual rateable value of the building in section 154.\n",
      "Section 156 provides for the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city, their rateable value, the names of persons primarily liable for payment of the property tax on such buildings and of the amount for which each building has been assessed.\n",
      "Section 167 lays down that the assess ment book need not be prepared every official year but public notices shall be given in accordance with sections 160 to 162 every year and the provisions o+ the said sec tions and of sections 163 and 167 shall be applicable each year.\n",
      "These sections lay down a procedure for hearing objections and complaints against entries in the assessment book.\n",

      "This appeal arises out of a suit brought by the respondent in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad, for recovery of arrears of royalty and cess from the appellant and another alleged to be due under a compromise decree passed on the 6th March, 1923, in a previ ous suit between the predecessors in interest of the par ties.\n",
      "The only plea which is material for the purpose of this appeal is that the compromise decree not having been registered was inadmissible in evidence.\n",
      "The courts below held that the document did not require registration and gave effect to its terms in decreeing the suit.\n",
      "The second defendant has preferred this appeal.\n",
      "The facts are not now in dispute and may be briefly stated.\n",
      "On 11th March, 1921, one Kumar Krishna Prasad Singh (hereinafter referred to as Kumar) granted a perma nent lease of the right to the underground coal in 5,800 bighas of land belonging to him to Shibsaran Singh and Sitaram Singh (hereinafter referred to as the Singhs) by a registered patta stipulating for a salami of Rs. 8,000 and royalty at the rate of 2a.\n",

      "835 the Deoshis agreed inter alia to pay royalty at the rate of 2a. per ton on all classes of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 750 a year.\n",
      "The Singhs feeling themselves aggrieved by the latter transaction brought a title suit (No. 1291 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhanbad for a declaration of their title and for possession of the 500 bighas leased to the Deoshis under the aforesaid patta of 7th June, 1921.\n",
      "To that suit Kumar was made a party as defendant No. 3, the Deoshis being defendants 1 and 2.\n",
      "The suit was however cornpromised on 6th March, 1923, by all the parties and a decree based on the compromise was also passed on the same day.\n",
      "The interest of the Singhs was brought to sale in 193S in execution of a decree obtained against them and was purchased by the plaintiff who insti tuted the presnt suit on 3rd October, 1942, claiming the royalty and cesses payable under the compromise decree for the period from Pous 1345 to Asadh 1349 B.S. from defendants 1 and 2 as the representatives of the Deoshis who entered into the compromise of March, 1923.\n",
      "In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties, it is necessary to set out the relevant terms of the compro mise decree which are as follows : \"The plaintiffs (the Singhs) within two months from this date shall pay Rs. 8,000 as salami to defendant No. 3 (Kumar).\n",
      "Otherwise all the terms of the compromise Will stand cancelled and the plaintiffs shall not be competent to claim any right to or possession over the.land covered by the patta dated 11th March, 1921.\n",
      "The patta which defend ant No. 3 executed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of 5,800 bighas of coal land in village Rahraband shall remain in force, and the plaintiffs will get a decree of declara tion of their right and title to the 500 bighas of coal land in dispute but defendants 1 and 2 (the Deoshis) shall hold possession as tenants.\n",
      "Besides the terms mentioned below, defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound by all the remaining terms under which they took settlement of the 500 bighas of coal land from defendant No. 3 under 836 patta and Kabuliyat, and both the defendants 1 and 2 shall possess the same under the plaintiffs from generation to generation and all the terms of the said patta and Kabuliyat shall remain effective and in force between them.\n",
      "Both the defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound to pay to the plain tiffs commission at the rate of 2a.\n",

      "The defendants 1 and 2 within one month from the date of payment of Rs. 8,000 as aforesaid to defendant No. 3 shall execute a new Kabuliyat in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the modified terms stated above, i.e., on the condition to pay commission at the rate of 2a.\n",
      "per ton.\n",
      "In the new patta which defendant No. 3 will execute in favour of the plaintiffs he shall embody the condition that the annual minimum royalty will be Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 and commission will be at the rate of la. 9p.\n",

      "\" 837 The answer to the question whether this compromise decree requires registration depends on the legal effect of the changes in the status quo ante of the parties brought about by the document.\n",
      "A careful analysis reveals the following alterations : (1) In the lease to the Singhs, the rate of royalty or commission was reduced from 2a.\n",
      "per ton of coal raised to la.\n",
      "per ton and the minimum royalty was reduced from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 6,000 while the area of coal land in their khas possession was reduced by 500 bighas. (2) In the lease to the Deoshis the rate of royalty or commission was enhanced from 2a.\n",
      "per ton to 2a.\n",
      "per ton and tiffs was made payable to the Singhs.\n",
      "The Singhs and the Deoshis were brought into a new legal relationship, the former accepting the latter as tenants holding the disputed 500 bighas under them in consideration of the latter agreeing to pay the enhanced royalty to the former. (4) The whole arrangement was made conditional on the Singhs paying Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months from the date of the compromise, it being expressly provided that the Singhs were not to be entitled to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed area of 503 bighas which evidently had not till then passed into their possession.\n",
      "Now, sub section (1) of section 17 of the , enumerates five categories of documents of which regis tration is made compulsory which include\" (d) leases of immoveable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent;\".\n",
      "Sub sec tion (2) however provided that \"nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub section (1)applies to . (vi) any decree or order of court.\n",
      "\" It may be mentioned in passing that this clause was amended with affect from the 1st April, 1930, by the , so as to exclude from the scope of the exception compromise decrees comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject matter of the suit.\n",
      "But 838 the amendment cannot affect the document here in question which came into existence in 1923.\n",
      "Before the amendment, the clause was held to cover even compromise decrees comprising immovable property which was not the subject matter of the suit: [Vide Hemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co. ( ')].\n",
      "That decision applies to the present case and obviates the objection that because the compromise in question covered also the remaining 5,300 bighas which were not the subject matter of the title suit of 1921, it was outside the scope of the exception in sub section (2), clause (vi).\n",
      "The only question, therefore, is whether the compromise decree is a \"lease\" [which expression includes \"an agreement to lease\" by the definition in section 2 (7)] within the meaning of el.\n",
      "(d) of sub section (1).\n",
      "It is obvious that if the compromise decree fails within clause (d) of sub section (1) it would not be protected under clause (vi) of sub section (2) which excepts only documents falling under the categories (b) and (c) of sub section (1).\n",
      "The High Court was of opinion that, on a proper construction of the terms of the compromise, it did not fall under clause (d).\n",
      "Mano har Lall J., who delivered the leading judgment, observed: \"It was a tripartite agreement embodied in the decree of the court and was, therefore, exempt from registration.\n",
      "It will be oh.served also that so far as the defendants were con cerned, their possession of the 500 bighas was not inter fered with and they still remained in possession as the lessees, but instead of paying the royalty to the plaintiffs it was agreed between all the parties that the defendants would pay the royalty in future to Shibsaran and Sitcram.\n",

      "He was prosecuted for storing paddy without a licence in excess of the quantity permitted by the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947.\n",
      "He admitted storage and possession of 550 maunds of paddy, but pleaded that he did not know that any licence was necessary.\n",
      "The 'Additional District Magistrate recorded a plea of guilty, but imposed him a fine of Rs. 50 only, as he considered his ignorance of the provisions of the Food Grains Control Order to be genuine.\n",
      "The stock of paddy was left in the possession of the appellant by the Procurement Inspector under a Jimmanama or security bond executed in his favour.\n",
      "He was subsequently unable to produce it before the court, as the whole of it was taken away by a Congress M.L.A. for affording relief to those who suffered in the earthquake, and so, the appellant was ordered to procure a similar quantity of paddy after taking an appropriate licence, and to make over the same to the procurement department payment of the price.\n",
      "The District Magistrate, being moved to do so by the procurement department, referred the case to the High Court under section 438, Criminal Procedure Code, for enhancement of the sentence, as in his opinion the sentence was unduly lenient and the Jimmanama, which was admittedly broken, should have been forfeited.\n",
      "128 The reference was accepted by the High Court, and the sent ence was enhanced to rigorous ' imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs. 1,000.\n",

      "Court for a certificate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution that the case was a fit one for appeal to this Court.\n",
      "This application was granted.\n",
      "Out of the three points urged for the appellant, two were rejected, but the third one was accepted as a good ground, namely, that there was a contravention of the provisions of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code and that consequently the, trial before the Additional District Magistrate was void.\n",
      "One of the contentions urged before us was that Shri C.K. Bhuyan was not a \"Director\" at all and therefore there was no valid sanction under section 38 of the Order.\n",
      "A notifications dated 16th May) 1950, and published in the Assam Gazette of the 24th May, 1950, was produced before us to show that Sri C.K. Bhuyan was an Additional Deputy Commissioner and it was conceded by the appellant 's counsel before the High Court that if he was a Deputy Commissioner, he would be a Director under the Order, as all Deputy Commissioners in Assam were notified as Directors for the purposes of the Order.\n",
      "Mr. Jindra Lal sought to draw a distinction between a Deputy Commissioner and an Additional Deputy Commissioner in this respect, but there is no warrant for the same,, apart from the circumstance that it is a question of fact which has to be investigated afresh, and which we cannot allow to be raised now for the first time.\n",
      "The primary question to consider in this appeal is whether there has been any infringement of Section 556, Criminal Procedure Code, and a consequent want of jurisdiction in the court which tried the offence.\n",
      "The facts relevant to this question lie 129 within a narrow compass.\n",
      "The Procurement Inspector sent a report , Ist July,1950 about the nature of the offence ; he wrote out a short note the, subject, and requested that the accused might be prosecuted and the Assistant Director of Procurement, Dibru garh, might be authorised to dispose of the paddy immediately to avoid loss due to deterioration, Sri 0.\n",
      "K. Bhuyan,who was the then District Magistrate Lakhimpur, made the following order: \"Prosecution sanctioned under section 7 (1) of ,the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, for violation of sections 3 and 7 of the Assam Food Grains Oontrol Order, 1947.\n",
      "\" The case happened to be tried by the same gentleman in his capacity as Addtional District Magistrate, and the accused was convicted as aforesaid.\n",
      "The argument for the appellant was that having sanctioned the prosecution, Sri C.K. Bhuyan became \"personally interested\" in the case within the meaning of section 556, and was therefore incompetent to try the same.\n",
      "It was contended that the trial was not only irregular but illegal.\n",
      "There is no question that \"personal interest\" within the meaning of the section is not limited to private interest, and that it may well include official interest also.\n",
      "But what is the extent of the interest which will attract the disability is a subject which different views are possible and have been taken.\n",
      "Section 556 itself indicates the difficulty.\n",
      "The Explanation to the section runs in these terms: \"A Judge or Magistrate shall not be deemed a party, or personally interested, within the , meaning of this section, to or in any case by reason only that be is a Municipal Commissioner or otherwise concerned therein in a public capacity, or by reason only that he has viewed the place in which an offence, is alleged to have been committed, or any other place .in which any other transaction material to the case 'is alleged to have occurred, and made an inquiry III connection with the case.\n",
      "\" 130 This shows that to be connected with a case in a public capacity is not by itself enough to render the person incompetent to try it.\n",
      "Even if he had made an enquiry in connection with this case, it would not matter.\n",
      "But look at the illustration: \"A, as collector, upon consideration of information furnished to him, directs the prosecution of B for a breach of the excise laws.\n",
      "A is disqualified from trying this case as a Magistrate.\n",
      "\" It is evident from the words of the illustration that if a prosecution is directed by a person in one capacity, he shall not try the case acting in another capacity as a Magistrate.\n",
      "The explanation and illustration lend some support to the view that there is a distinction between a passive interest and an active interest, and that it is only in the latter case that the disqualification arises or intervenes.\n",
      "Under sub section (3) (a) of section 2 of the Assam Food Grains Control Order \"Director\" means \"the Director of Supply, Assam, and includes, for the purpose of any specific. provision of this Order, any other officer duly authorised in that behalf by him or by the Provincial Government by notification in the Official Gazette.\n",
      "\" Section 38 provides: No prosecution in respect of an alleged contravention of any provision of this Order shall be instituted without the sanction of the Director.\n",
      "\" A little confusion is likely to arise from the employment of the word \" Director\" in the Control Order and the word \"directs\" in the illustration to section 556 of the Code '.\n",
      "It has to be borne in mind that a sanction by the Director within the meaning of the Code does not necessarily mean \"a direction given by him that the accused should be prosecuted.\n",
      "\" In both cases of sanction and direction, an application of the mind is necessary, but there is this essential difference that in the one case there is a legal impediment to the prosecution if there be no sanction, and in the other case, there is a positive order that 131 the prosecution should be launched.\n",
      "For a sanction, all that is necessary for one to be satisfied about is the existence of a prima facie case.\n",
      "In the case of a, direction, a further element that the accused deserves to be prosecuted is involved.\n",
      "The question whether a Magistrate is personally interested or not has essentially to be decided the facts in each case.\n",
      "Pecuniary interest, however small, will be a disqualification but as regards other kinds of interest, there is no measure or standard except that it should be a substantial one, giving rise to a real bias, or a reasonable apprehension the part of the accused of such bias.\n",
      ", The maxim \" Nemo debet esse judex in propria sua causa\" applies only when the interest attributed is such as to render the case his own cause.\n",
      "The fulfllment of a technical requirement imposed by a statute may not, in many cases, amount to a mental satisfaction of the truth of the facts placed before the officer.\n",
      "Whether sanction should be granted or not may conceivably depend upon consideration extraneous to the merits of the case.\n",
      "But where a prosecution is directed, it means that the authority who gives the direction is satisfied in his own mind that the case must be initiated.\n",
      "Sanction is in the nature of a permission while a direction is in the nature of a command.\n",
      "Let us now examine some of the decisions the subject.\n",
      "For the appellant, strong reliance was placed the judgment of the Privy Council in Gokulchand Dwarkadas vs King(1), and it was argued the basis of some of the observations of the Judicial Committee that a sanction was an important and substantial matter and not a mere formality.\n",
      "The facts in that case were that while there was a sanction of the Government for a prosecution under the Cotton Cloth and Yarn Control, Order, there was nothing in the sanction itself, or in the shape of extraneous evidence, to show that the sanction was accorded after the relevant facts were placed before the sanctioning authority.\n",

      "Where an officer as a District Magistrate exercising his powers under section 7(1) of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, sanctioned the prosecution of a person for violation of sections 3 and 7 of the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947, and the same officer as Additional District Magistrate tried and convicted the accused, and it was contended that as the officer had given sanction for prosecution he was \"personally interested\" in the case within the meaning of section 656, Criminal Procedure Code, and the trial and conviction were therefore illegal: Held, that bymerely giving sanction for prosecution he did not become personally interested\" in the case and the trial and conviction were not illegal.\n",
      "In both cases of sanction and direction to prosecute, an application of the mind is necessary, but there is this essential difference that in the one case there is a legal impediment to the prosecution if there is no sanction and in the other case there is a positive order that the prosecution should be launched.\n",
      "For a sanction, all that is necessary for one to be satisfied about is the existence of a prima facie case.\n",
      "In the case of a direction, a further element that the accused deserves to be prosecuted is involved.\n",
      "Whether sanction should be granted or not may conceivably depend considerations extraneous to the merits of the case.\n",
      "But where a prosecution is directed, it means that the authority who gives the sanction is satisfied in his own mind that the case must be initiated.\n",
      "Sanction is in the nature of a permission, while direction is in the nature of a command.\n",

    "### Dataset Compatibility Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the types of `text` and `labels` in the various datasets, here is the analysis of which datasets can be combined:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **ds1_train** and **ds2**\n",
    "- **Text**: Both datasets have `str` as the type for the `text` column, making them compatible for combining.\n",
    "- **Labels**: Both datasets have `str` as the type for the `labels` column. While it's unusual to use `str` for labels, these two datasets are compatible due to the matching types.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: These datasets can be combined directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **ds4_train** and **ds5_train**\n",
    "- **Text**: Both datasets have `list of ['str']` as the type for the `text` column, making them compatible.\n",
    "- **Labels**: Both datasets have `list of ['int']` as the dominant type for the `labels` column, though **ds4_train** has 914 entries with `list of []` and **ds5_train** has 134 entries with `list of []`. These empty lists in the labels will need to be handled.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: These datasets can be combined, but the empty lists in the `labels` column should be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **ds6_train**\n",
    "- **Text**: The `text` column is `str`, so it is compatible with **ds1_train**, **ds2**, **ds7_train**, and **ds8_train**.\n",
    "- **Labels**: Most entries in the `labels` column are `list of ['int']`, but there are 4 entries with `list of []`. These empty label lists need to be handled before combining with other datasets.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: This dataset can be combined with **ds4_train** and **ds5_train** (after handling empty lists), but not directly with **ds1_train** or **ds2** unless the `str` labels are converted to `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **ds7_train** and **ds8_train**\n",
    "- **Text**: Both datasets have `str` as the type for the `text` column, making them compatible for combining.\n",
    "- **Labels**: Both datasets have `int` as the type for the `labels` column, so they are compatible.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: These datasets can be combined directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations:\n",
    "- **Combine these datasets:**\n",
    "  - **ds1_train** + **ds2**: Same `str` type for text and labels.\n",
    "  - **ds7_train** + **ds8_train**: Same `str` text and `int` labels.\n",
    "  - **ds4_train** + **ds5_train**: Same `list of ['str']` text and `list of ['int']` labels (after handling empty label lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handle empty lists** in the `labels` columns of **ds4_train**, **ds5_train**, and **ds6_train** before combining them with other datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consider converting `labels`** in **ds1_train** and **ds2** from `str` to `int` if combining them with **ds6_train**, **ds7_train**, or **ds8_train**.\n"

      "Appeal from the High Court of judicature, Bombay, in a reference under section 66 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1022.\n",
      "K.M. Munshi (N. P. Nathvani, with him), for the appel lant. ' M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (H. J. Umrigar, with him), for the respondent. 1950.\n",
      "May 26.\n",
      "The judgment of the Court was delivered by MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN J.\n",
      "This is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in an income tax matter and it raises the question whether munici pal property tax and urban immoveable property tax payable under the relevant Bombay Acts are allowable deductions under section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act.\n",
      "The assessee company is an investment company deriving its income from properties in the city of Bombay.\n",
      "For the assessment year 1940 41 the net income of the assessee under the head \"property\" was computed by the Income tax Officer in the sum of Rs. 6,21,764 after deducting from gross rents certain payments.\n",
      "The company had paid during the relevant year Rs. 1,22,675 as municipal property tax and Rs. 32,760 as urban property tax.\n",
      "Deduction of these two sums was claimed under the provisions of section 9 the Act.\n",
      "Out of the first item a deduction in the sum of Rs. 48,572 was allowed on the ground that this item represented tenants ' burdens paid by the assessee, otherwise the claim was disal lowed.\n",
      "The, appeals of the assessee to the Appellate As sistant Commissioner and to the Income tax Appellate Tribu nal were unsuccessful.\n",
      "The Tribunal, however, agreed to refer two questions of law to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, namely, (1) Whether the municipal taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under 555 the provisions of section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act; (2) Whether the urban immoveable property taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under section 9 (1) (iv) or under section 9 (1) (v) of the Indian Income tax Act.\n",
      "A supplementary reference was made covering a third question which was not raised before us and it is not there fore necessary to refer to it.\n",
      "The High Court answered all the three questions in the negative and hence this appeal.\n",
      "The question for our determination is whether the munic ipal property tax and urban immoveable property tax can be deducted as an allowance under clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act.\n",
      "The decision of the point depends firstly on the construction of the language employed in sub clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act, and secondly, on a finding as to the true nature and character of the liability of the owner under the relevant Bombay Acts for the payment of these taxes.\n",
      "Section 9 along with the relevant clause runs thus: (1) The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head ' income from property ' in respect of the bona fide annual value of property consisting of any buildings or lands appurtenant thereto of Which he is the owner, . . subject to the following allowances, namely : (iv) where the property is subject to a mortgage or other capital charge, the amount of any interest on such mortgage or charge; where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the. amount of such charge; where the property is subject to a ground rent, the amount of such ground rent; and, where the property has been acquired, constructed, repaired, renewed or recon structed with borrowed capital, the amount of any interest payable on such capital; . . . \" It will be seen that clause (iv) consists of four sub clauses corresponding to the four deductions allowed 556 under the clause.\n",
      "Before the amending Act of 1939, clause (iv) contained only the first, third and fourth sub clauses.\n",
      "Under the first sub clause interest is deductible whether the amount borrowed on the security of the property was spent on the property or not.\n",
      "There is no question of any capital or other expenditure on the property.\n",
      "The expression \"capital charge\" in the sub clause cannot connote a charge on the capital, that is, the property assessed.\n",
      "That would be a redundancy as the opening words themselves clearly indicate that the charge is on the property.\n",
      "We are therefore of opinion that capital charge here could only mean a charge created for a capital sum, i.e., a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.\n",
      "In 1933 the Privy Council decided the case of Bijoy Singh.\n",
      "Dudhuria vs Commissioner of Income tax, Calcutta (1 ).\n",
      "It was not an assessment under section 9 but an assess ment on the general income of an assessee who was liable to pay maintenance for his step mother which had been charged on all his assets by a decree of Court.\n",
      "It was not a li ability voluntarily incurred by him but one cast on him by law.\n",
      "The Privy Council held that the amount paid by him in discharge of that liability formed no part of his real income and so should not be included in his assessment.\n",
      "Though the decision proceeded on the principle that the outgoings were not part of the assessee 's income at all, the framers of the amending Act of 1939 wanted, apparently, to extend the principle, so far as the assessment of property was concerned, even to cases where obligatory payments had to be made out of the assessee 's income from the property charged with such payments, and the second sub clause, namely, \"where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the amount of such charge\" was added.\n",
      "It is this sub clause which the appellant invokes in support of its claim to deduction of the municipal and urban, property taxes in the present case.\n",
      "In view of the opening words of the newly added sub clause, the expression \"capital charge\" also used therein cannot have reference to a charge on the property, and we think it must (1) I.L.R. 60 cal.\n",
      "557 be understood in the same sense as in sub clause (1); that is to say, the first sub clause having provided for deduc tion of interest where a capital sum is charged on the property, this sub clause provides for a deduction of annual sums so charged, such sums not being capital sums, the limiting words being intended to exclude cases where capital raised on the security of the property is made repayable in instalments.\n",
      "In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji (1), a Bench of the Bombay High Court considered the meaning of these words.\n",
      "As regards \"annual charge,\" Beau mont C.J. observed as follows : \"The words, I think, would cover a charge to secure an annual liability.\" Kania J., as he then was, said as follows : \"I do not see how a charge can be annual unless it means a charge in respect of a payment to be made annually.\" This construction of the words has been followed in the judgment under appeal.\n",
      "In Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Income tax (2) (the connected appeal before us), the Bench of the Allahabad High Court agreed with the construction placed on these words in the Bombay case, i.e., the words \"annual charge\" mean a charge to secure an annual liability.\n",
      "It is therefore clear that there is no conflict of judicial deci sions as to the meaning of the phrase \"annual charge\" occur ring in section 3 (1) (iv) and the meaning given is the natural meaning of these words.\n",
      "As to the phrase \"capital charge\", Beaumont C.J. in the case above referred to took the view that the words mean a charge on capital.\n",
      "Kania J., however, took a different view and observed that he was not prepared to accept the sugges tion that a document which provides for a certain payment to be made monthly or annually and charged on immoveable property or the estate of an individual becomes a capital charge.\n",
      "In the Allahabad judgment under appeal these (1) I.L.R. (2) I.L.R. 1944 All.\n",
      "558 words were considered as not meaning a charge on capital.\n",
      "It was said that if an annual charge means a charge to secure the discharge of an annual liability, then, capital charge means a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.\n",
      "We think this construction is a natu ral construction of the section and is right.\n",
      "The determination of the point whether the taxes in dispute fall within the ambit of the phrase \"annual charge not being a capital charge\" depends on the provisions of the statutes under which they are levied.\n",
      "Section 143 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, authorises the levy of a general tax on all buildings and lands in the city.\n",
      "The primary responsibility to pay this property tax is on the lessor (vide section 146 of the Act).\n",
      "In order to assess the tax provision has been made for the determination of the annual rateable value of the building in section 154.\n",
      "Section 156 provides for the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city, their rateable value, the names of persons primarily liable for payment of the property tax on such buildings and of the amount for which each building has been assessed.\n",
      "Section 167 lays down that the assess ment book need not be prepared every official year but public notices shall be given in accordance with sections 160 to 162 every year and the provisions o+ the said sec tions and of sections 163 and 167 shall be applicable each year.\n",
      "These sections lay down a procedure for hearing objections and complaints against entries in the assessment book.\n",
      "From these provisions it is clear ' that the liabil ity for the tax is determined at the beginning of each official year and the tax is an annual one.\n",
      "It recurs from year to year.\n",
      "Sections 143to 168 concern themselves with the imposition, liability and assessment of the tax for the year.\n",
      "The amount of the tax for the year and the liability for its payment having been determined, the Act then pre scribes for its collection in the chapter \"The collection of taxes.\n",
      "\" Section 197 provides that each of the property taxes shall be payable in 559 advance in half yearly instalments on each first day  ...\n",
      "Labels: The charge created in respect of municipal property tax by section 212 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, is an \"annual charge not being a capital charge\" within the mean ing of section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act, 199.2, and the amount of such charge should therefore be deducted in computing the income from such property for the purposes of section 9 of the Indian Income tax Act.\n",
      "The charge in respect of urban immoveable property tax created by the Bombay Finance Act, 1939 is similar in character and the amount of such charge should also be deducted.\n",
      "The expression \"capital charge\" in s.9(1) (iv) means a charge created for a capital sum,that is to say, a charge created to. ' secure the discharge of a liability of a capi tal nature; and an \"annual charge\" means a charge to secure an annual liabili ty. 554\n",

      "The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.\n",
      "This appeal arises out of a suit brought by the respondent in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad, for recovery of arrears of royalty and cess from the appellant and another alleged to be due under a compromise decree passed on the 6th March, 1923, in a previ ous suit between the predecessors in interest of the par ties.\n",
      "The only plea which is material for the purpose of this appeal is that the compromise decree not having been registered was inadmissible in evidence.\n",
      "The courts below held that the document did not require registration and gave effect to its terms in decreeing the suit.\n",
      "The second defendant has preferred this appeal.\n",
      "The facts are not now in dispute and may be briefly stated.\n",
      "On 11th March, 1921, one Kumar Krishna Prasad Singh (hereinafter referred to as Kumar) granted a perma nent lease of the right to the underground coal in 5,800 bighas of land belonging to him to Shibsaran Singh and Sitaram Singh (hereinafter referred to as the Singhs) by a registered patta stipulating for a salami of Rs. 8,000 and royalty at the rate of 2a.\n",
      "per ton of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 8,000 and for certain other cesses and interest.\n",
      "On 7th June, 1921, Kumar executed another perma nent patta leasing the right to the coal in 500 bighas out of the 5,800 bighas referred to above to one Prayngji Bal lavji Deoshi and his son Harakchand Deoshi (hereinafter referred to as the Deoshis).\n",
      "By this document.\n",
      "835 the Deoshis agreed inter alia to pay royalty at the rate of 2a. per ton on all classes of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 750 a year.\n",
      "The Singhs feeling themselves aggrieved by the latter transaction brought a title suit (No. 1291 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhanbad for a declaration of their title and for possession of the 500 bighas leased to the Deoshis under the aforesaid patta of 7th June, 1921.\n",
      "To that suit Kumar was made a party as defendant No. 3, the Deoshis being defendants 1 and 2.\n",
      "The suit was however cornpromised on 6th March, 1923, by all the parties and a decree based on the compromise was also passed on the same day.\n",
      "The interest of the Singhs was brought to sale in 193S in execution of a decree obtained against them and was purchased by the plaintiff who insti tuted the presnt suit on 3rd October, 1942, claiming the royalty and cesses payable under the compromise decree for the period from Pous 1345 to Asadh 1349 B.S. from defendants 1 and 2 as the representatives of the Deoshis who entered into the compromise of March, 1923.\n",
      "In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties, it is necessary to set out the relevant terms of the compro mise decree which are as follows : \"The plaintiffs (the Singhs) within two months from this date shall pay Rs. 8,000 as salami to defendant No. 3 (Kumar).\n",
      "Otherwise all the terms of the compromise Will stand cancelled and the plaintiffs shall not be competent to claim any right to or possession over the.land covered by the patta dated 11th March, 1921.\n",
      "The patta which defend ant No. 3 executed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of 5,800 bighas of coal land in village Rahraband shall remain in force, and the plaintiffs will get a decree of declara tion of their right and title to the 500 bighas of coal land in dispute but defendants 1 and 2 (the Deoshis) shall hold possession as tenants.\n",
      "Besides the terms mentioned below, defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound by all the remaining terms under which they took settlement of the 500 bighas of coal land from defendant No. 3 under 836 patta and Kabuliyat, and both the defendants 1 and 2 shall possess the same under the plaintiffs from generation to generation and all the terms of the said patta and Kabuliyat shall remain effective and in force between them.\n",
      "Both the defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound to pay to the plain tiffs commission at the rate of 2a.\n",
      "per ton on all sorts of coal instead of 2a.\n",
      "a ton as stated before in the patta of 5,800 bighas of land settled with the plaintiffs.\n",
      "The plaintiffs shall pay to defendant No. 3 in future the mini mum royalty of Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 as stipulated in the original patta of 11 th March 1921 and commission at the rate of la.\n",
      "a ton in place of 2a.\n",
      "a ton as stipulat ed in the patta of March 21 .\n",
      "Unless the plaintiffs pay to the defendant No. 3 Rs. 8,000 within 2 months from this day they shall not be competent to take out execution of this decree, nor shall they be competent to take posses sion of the land in dispute.\n",
      "The defendants 1 and 2 within one month from the date of payment of Rs. 8,000 as aforesaid to defendant No. 3 shall execute a new Kabuliyat in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the modified terms stated above, i.e., on the condition to pay commission at the rate of 2a.\n",
      "per ton.\n",
      "In the new patta which defendant No. 3 will execute in favour of the plaintiffs he shall embody the condition that the annual minimum royalty will be Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 and commission will be at the rate of la. 9p.\n",
      "per ton in place of 2a.\n",

      "If the defendant No. 3 does not execute the parts on the aforesaid modified terms in favour 'of the plaintiffs within the time aforesaid and both the defendants 1 and 2 also do not execute a kabuliyat on the aforesaid modified terms, then this very rafanama shall be treated as the parts and kabuliyat, and the plaintiffs in accordance with the terms of the rafanama shall pay to defendant No. 3, Rs. 6,000 only as minimum royalty and commission at the rate of la.\n",
      "per ton with respect to 5,800 bighas and shall continue to realise commission at the rate of 2a. 6p. per ton from defendants 1 and 2 who shall remain bound to pay the same.\n",
      "\" 837 The answer to the question whether this compromise decree requires registration depends on the legal effect of the changes in the status quo ante of the parties brought about by the document.\n",
      "A careful analysis reveals the following alterations : (1) In the lease to the Singhs, the rate of royalty or commission was reduced from 2a.\n",
      "per ton of coal raised to la.\n",
      "per ton and the minimum royalty was reduced from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 6,000 while the area of coal land in their khas possession was reduced by 500 bighas. (2) In the lease to the Deoshis the rate of royalty or commission was enhanced from 2a.\n",
      "per ton to 2a.\n",
      "per ton and tiffs was made payable to the Singhs.\n",
      "The Singhs and the Deoshis were brought into a new legal relationship, the former accepting the latter as tenants holding the disputed 500 bighas under them in consideration of the latter agreeing to pay the enhanced royalty to the former. (4) The whole arrangement was made conditional on the Singhs paying Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months from the date of the compromise, it being expressly provided that the Singhs were not to be entitled to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed area of 503 bighas which evidently had not till then passed into their possession.\n",
      "Now, sub section (1) of section 17 of the , enumerates five categories of documents of which regis tration is made compulsory which include\" (d) leases of immoveable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent;\".\n",
      "Sub sec tion (2) however provided that \"nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub section (1)applies to . (vi) any decree or order of court.\n",
      "\" It may be mentioned in passing that this clause was amended with affect from the 1st April, 1930, by the , so as to exclude from the scope of the exception compromise decrees comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject matter of the suit.\n",
      "But 838 the amendment cannot affect the document here in question which came into existence in 1923.\n",
      "Before the amendment, the clause was held to cover even compromise decrees comprising immovable property which was not the subject matter of the suit: [Vide Hemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co. ( ')].\n",
      "That decision applies to the present case and obviates the objection that because the compromise in question covered also the remaining 5,300 bighas which were not the subject matter of the title suit of 1921, it was outside the scope of the exception in sub section (2), clause (vi).\n",
      "The only question, therefore, is whether the compromise decree is a \"lease\" [which expression includes \"an agreement to lease\" by the definition in section 2 (7)] within the meaning of el.\n",
      "(d) of sub section (1).\n",
      "It is obvious that if the compromise decree fails within clause (d) of sub section (1) it would not be protected under clause (vi) of sub section (2) which excepts only documents falling under the categories (b) and (c) of sub section (1).\n",
      "The High Court was of opinion that, on a proper construction of the terms of the compromise, it did not fall under clause (d).\n",
      "Mano har Lall J., who delivered the leading judgment, observed: \"It was a tripartite agreement embodied in the decree of the court and was, therefore, exempt from registration.\n",
      "It will be oh.served also that so far as the defendants were con cerned, their possession of the 500 bighas was not inter fered with and they still remained in possession as the lessees, but instead of paying the royalty to the plaintiffs it was agreed between all the parties that the defendants would pay the royalty in future to Shibsaran and Sitcram.\n",

      "Rameshwar Bhartia, the appellant, is a shopkeeper in Assam.\n",
      "He was prosecuted for storing paddy without a licence in excess of the quantity permitted by the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947.\n",
      "He admitted storage and possession of 550 maunds of paddy, but pleaded that he did not know that any licence was necessary.\n",
      "The 'Additional District Magistrate recorded a plea of guilty, but imposed him a fine of Rs. 50 only, as he considered his ignorance of the provisions of the Food Grains Control Order to be genuine.\n",
      "The stock of paddy was left in the possession of the appellant by the Procurement Inspector under a Jimmanama or security bond executed in his favour.\n",
      "He was subsequently unable to produce it before the court, as the whole of it was taken away by a Congress M.L.A. for affording relief to those who suffered in the earthquake, and so, the appellant was ordered to procure a similar quantity of paddy after taking an appropriate licence, and to make over the same to the procurement department payment of the price.\n",
      "The District Magistrate, being moved to do so by the procurement department, referred the case to the High Court under section 438, Criminal Procedure Code, for enhancement of the sentence, as in his opinion the sentence was unduly lenient and the Jimmanama, which was admittedly broken, should have been forfeited.\n",
      "128 The reference was accepted by the High Court, and the sent ence was enhanced to rigorous ' imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs. 1,000.\n",
      "As regards the Jimmanama, the case was sent back to the trial court for taking action according to law under section 514, Criminal Procedure Code, for its forfeiture.\n",
      "The appellant applied to the High.\n",
      "Court for a certificate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution that the case was a fit one for appeal to this Court.\n",
      "This application was granted.\n",
      "Out of the three points urged for the appellant, two were rejected, but the third one was accepted as a good ground, namely, that there was a contravention of the provisions of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code and that consequently the, trial before the Additional District Magistrate was void.\n",
      "One of the contentions urged before us was that Shri C.K. Bhuyan was not a \"Director\" at all and therefore there was no valid sanction under section 38 of the Order.\n",
      "A notifications dated 16th May) 1950, and published in the Assam Gazette of the 24th May, 1950, was produced before us to show that Sri C.K. Bhuyan was an Additional Deputy Commissioner and it was conceded by the appellant 's counsel before the High Court that if he was a Deputy Commissioner, he would be a Director under the Order, as all Deputy Commissioners in Assam were notified as Directors for the purposes of the Order.\n",
      "Mr. Jindra Lal sought to draw a distinction between a Deputy Commissioner and an Additional Deputy Commissioner in this respect, but there is no warrant for the same,, apart from the circumstance that it is a question of fact which has to be investigated afresh, and which we cannot allow to be raised now for the first time.\n",
      "The primary question to consider in this appeal is whether there has been any infringement of Section 556, Criminal Procedure Code, and a consequent want of jurisdiction in the court which tried the offence.\n",
      "The facts relevant to this question lie 129 within a narrow compass.\n",
      "The Procurement Inspector sent a report , Ist July,1950 about the nature of the offence ; he wrote out a short note the, subject, and requested that the accused might be prosecuted and the Assistant Director of Procurement, Dibru garh, might be authorised to dispose of the paddy immediately to avoid loss due to deterioration, Sri 0.\n",
      "K. Bhuyan,who was the then District Magistrate Lakhimpur, made the following order: \"Prosecution sanctioned under section 7 (1) of ,the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, for violation of sections 3 and 7 of the Assam Food Grains Oontrol Order, 1947.\n",
      "\" The case happened to be tried by the same gentleman in his capacity as Addtional District Magistrate, and the accused was convicted as aforesaid.\n",
      "The argument for the appellant was that having sanctioned the prosecution, Sri C.K. Bhuyan became \"personally interested\" in the case within the meaning of section 556, and was therefore incompetent to try the same.\n",

      "There is no question that \"personal interest\" within the meaning of the section is not limited to private interest, and that it may well include official interest also.\n",
      "But what is the extent of the interest which will attract the disability is a subject which different views are possible and have been taken.\n",
      "Section 556 itself indicates the difficulty.\n",
      "The Explanation to the section runs in these terms: \"A Judge or Magistrate shall not be deemed a party, or personally interested, within the , meaning of this section, to or in any case by reason only that be is a Municipal Commissioner or otherwise concerned therein in a public capacity, or by reason only that he has viewed the place in which an offence, is alleged to have been committed, or any other place .in which any other transaction material to the case 'is alleged to have occurred, and made an inquiry III connection with the case.\n",
      "\" 130 This shows that to be connected with a case in a public capacity is not by itself enough to render the person incompetent to try it.\n",
      "Even if he had made an enquiry in connection with this case, it would not matter.\n",
      "But look at the illustration: \"A, as collector, upon consideration of information furnished to him, directs the prosecution of B for a breach of the excise laws.\n",
      "A is disqualified from trying this case as a Magistrate.\n",
      "\" It is evident from the words of the illustration that if a prosecution is directed by a person in one capacity, he shall not try the case acting in another capacity as a Magistrate.\n",
      "The explanation and illustration lend some support to the view that there is a distinction between a passive interest and an active interest, and that it is only in the latter case that the disqualification arises or intervenes.\n",
      "Under sub section (3) (a) of section 2 of the Assam Food Grains Control Order \"Director\" means \"the Director of Supply, Assam, and includes, for the purpose of any specific. provision of this Order, any other officer duly authorised in that behalf by him or by the Provincial Government by notification in the Official Gazette.\n",
      "\" Section 38 provides: No prosecution in respect of an alleged contravention of any provision of this Order shall be instituted without the sanction of the Director.\n",
      "\" A little confusion is likely to arise from the employment of the word \" Director\" in the Control Order and the word \"directs\" in the illustration to section 556 of the Code '.\n",
      "It has to be borne in mind that a sanction by the Director within the meaning of the Code does not necessarily mean \"a direction given by him that the accused should be prosecuted.\n",
      "\" In both cases of sanction and direction, an application of the mind is necessary, but there is this essential difference that in the one case there is a legal impediment to the prosecution if there be no sanction, and in the other case, there is a positive order that 131 the prosecution should be launched.\n",
      "For a sanction, all that is necessary for one to be satisfied about is the existence of a prima facie case.\n",
      "In the case of a, direction, a further element that the accused deserves to be prosecuted is involved.\n",
      "The question whether a Magistrate is personally interested or not has essentially to be decided the facts in each case.\n",
      "Pecuniary interest, however small, will be a disqualification but as regards other kinds of interest, there is no measure or standard except that it should be a substantial one, giving rise to a real bias, or a reasonable apprehension the part of the accused of such bias.\n",
      ", The maxim \" Nemo debet esse judex in propria sua causa\" applies only when the interest attributed is such as to render the case his own cause.\n",
      "The fulfllment of a technical requirement imposed by a statute may not, in many cases, amount to a mental satisfaction of the truth of the facts placed before the officer.\n",
      "Whether sanction should be granted or not may conceivably depend upon consideration extraneous to the merits of the case.\n",
      "But where a prosecution is directed, it means that the authority who gives the direction is satisfied in his own mind that the case must be initiated.\n",
      "Sanction is in the nature of a permission while a direction is in the nature of a command.\n",
      "Let us now examine some of the decisions the subject.\n",
      "For the appellant, strong reliance was placed the judgment of the Privy Council in Gokulchand Dwarkadas vs King(1), and it was argued the basis of some of the observations of the Judicial Committee that a sanction was an important and substantial matter and not a mere formality.\n",
      "The facts in that case were that while there was a sanction of the Government for a prosecution under the Cotton Cloth and Yarn Control, Order, there was nothing in the sanction itself, or in the shape of extraneous evidence, to show that the sanction was accorded after the relevant facts were placed before the sanctioning authority.\n",
      "To quote their Lordships ' own words; (1) (1948) 52 C.W.N.325.\n",

      "Appeal from the High Court of judicature, Bombay, in a reference under section 66 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1022.\n",
      "K.M. Munshi (N. P. Nathvani, with him), for the appel lant. ' M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (H. J. Umrigar, with him), for the respondent. 1950.\n",
      "May 26.\n",
      "The judgment of the Court was delivered by MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN J.\n",
      "This is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in an income tax matter and it raises the question whether munici pal property tax and urban immoveable property tax payable under the relevant Bombay Acts are allowable deductions under section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act.\n",
      "The assessee company is an investment company deriving its income from properties in the city of Bombay.\n",
      "For the assessment year 1940 41 the net income of the assessee under the head \"property\" was computed by the Income tax Officer in the sum of Rs. 6,21,764 after deducting from gross rents certain payments.\n",
      "The company had paid during the relevant year Rs. 1,22,675 as municipal property tax and Rs. 32,760 as urban property tax.\n",
      "Deduction of these two sums was claimed under the provisions of section 9 the Act.\n",
      "Out of the first item a deduction in the sum of Rs. 48,572 was allowed on the ground that this item represented tenants ' burdens paid by the assessee, otherwise the claim was disal lowed.\n",
      "The, appeals of the assessee to the Appellate As sistant Commissioner and to the Income tax Appellate Tribu nal were unsuccessful.\n",
      "The Tribunal, however, agreed to refer two questions of law to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, namely, (1) Whether the municipal taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under 555 the provisions of section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act; (2) Whether the urban immoveable property taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under section 9 (1) (iv) or under section 9 (1) (v) of the Indian Income tax Act.\n",
      "A supplementary reference was made covering a third question which was not raised before us and it is not there fore necessary to refer to it.\n",
      "The High Court answered all the three questions in the negative and hence this appeal.\n",
      "The question for our determination is whether the munic ipal property tax and urban immoveable property tax can be deducted as an allowance under clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act.\n",
      "The decision of the point depends firstly on the construction of the language employed in sub clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act, and secondly, on a finding as to the true nature and character of the liability of the owner under the relevant Bombay Acts for the payment of these taxes.\n",
      "Section 9 along with the relevant clause runs thus: (1) The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head ' income from property ' in respect of the bona fide annual value of property consisting of any buildings or lands appurtenant thereto of Which he is the owner, . . subject to the following allowances, namely : (iv) where the property is subject to a mortgage or other capital charge, the amount of any interest on such mortgage or charge; where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the. amount of such charge; where the property is subject to a ground rent, the amount of such ground rent; and, where the property has been acquired, constructed, repaired, renewed or recon structed with borrowed capital, the amount of any interest payable on such capital; . . . \" It will be seen that clause (iv) consists of four sub clauses corresponding to the four deductions allowed 556 under the clause.\n",
      "Before the amending Act of 1939, clause (iv) contained only the first, third and fourth sub clauses.\n",
      "Under the first sub clause interest is deductible whether the amount borrowed on the security of the property was spent on the property or not.\n",
      "There is no question of any capital or other expenditure on the property.\n",
      "The expression \"capital charge\" in the sub clause cannot connote a charge on the capital, that is, the property assessed.\n",
      "That would be a redundancy as the opening words themselves clearly indicate that the charge is on the property.\n",
      "We are therefore of opinion that capital charge here could only mean a charge created for a capital sum, i.e., a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.\n",
      "In 1933 the Privy Council decided the case of Bijoy Singh.\n",
      "Dudhuria vs Commissioner of Income tax, Calcutta (1 ).\n",
      "It was not an assessment under section 9 but an assess ment on the general income of an assessee who was liable to pay maintenance for his step mother which had been charged on all his assets by a decree of Court.\n",
      "It was not a li ability voluntarily incurred by him but one cast on him by law.\n",
      "The Privy Council held that the amount paid by him in discharge of that liability formed no part of his real income and so should not be included in his assessment.\n",
      "Though the decision proceeded on the principle that the outgoings were not part of the assessee 's income at all, the framers of the amending Act of 1939 wanted, apparently, to extend the principle, so far as the assessment of property was concerned, even to cases where obligatory payments had to be made out of the assessee 's income from the property charged with such payments, and the second sub clause, namely, \"where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the amount of such charge\" was added.\n",
      "It is this sub clause which the appellant invokes in support of its claim to deduction of the municipal and urban, property taxes in the present case.\n",
      "In view of the opening words of the newly added sub clause, the expression \"capital charge\" also used therein cannot have reference to a charge on the property, and we think it must (1) I.L.R. 60 cal.\n",
      "557 be understood in the same sense as in sub clause (1); that is to say, the first sub clause having provided for deduc tion of interest where a capital sum is charged on the property, this sub clause provides for a deduction of annual sums so charged, such sums not being capital sums, the limiting words being intended to exclude cases where capital raised on the security of the property is made repayable in instalments.\n",
      "In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji (1), a Bench of the Bombay High Court considered the meaning of these words.\n",
      "As regards \"annual charge,\" Beau mont C.J. observed as follows : \"The words, I think, would cover a charge to secure an annual liability.\" Kania J., as he then was, said as follows : \"I do not see how a charge can be annual unless it means a charge in respect of a payment to be made annually.\" This construction of the words has been followed in the judgment under appeal.\n",
      "In Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Income tax (2) (the connected appeal before us), the Bench of the Allahabad High Court agreed with the construction placed on these words in the Bombay case, i.e., the words \"annual charge\" mean a charge to secure an annual liability.\n",
      "It is therefore clear that there is no conflict of judicial deci sions as to the meaning of the phrase \"annual charge\" occur ring in section 3 (1) (iv) and the meaning given is the natural meaning of these words.\n",
      "As to the phrase \"capital charge\", Beaumont C.J. in the case above referred to took the view that the words mean a charge on capital.\n",
      "Kania J., however, took a different view and observed that he was not prepared to accept the sugges tion that a document which provides for a certain payment to be made monthly or annually and charged on immoveable property or the estate of an individual becomes a capital charge.\n",
      "In the Allahabad judgment under appeal these (1) I.L.R. (2) I.L.R. 1944 All.\n",
      "558 words were considered as not meaning a charge on capital.\n",
      "It was said that if an annual charge means a charge to secure the discharge of an annual liability, then, capital charge means a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.\n",
      "We think this construction is a natu ral construction of the section and is right.\n",
      "The determination of the point whether the taxes in dispute fall within the ambit of the phrase \"annual charge not being a capital charge\" depends on the provisions of the statutes under which they are levied.\n",
      "Section 143 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, authorises the levy of a general tax on all buildings and lands in the city.\n",
      "The primary responsibility to pay this property tax is on the lessor (vide section 146 of the Act).\n",
      "In order to assess the tax provision has been made for the determination of the annual rateable value of the building in section 154.\n",
      "Section 156 provides for the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city, their rateable value, the names of persons primarily liable for payment of the property tax on such buildings and of the amount for which each building has been assessed.\n",
      "Section 167 lays down that the assess ment book need not be prepared every official year but public notices shall be given in accordance with sections 160 to 162 every year and the provisions o+ the said sec tions and of sections 163 and 167 shall be applicable each year.\n",
      "These sections lay down a procedure for hearing objections and complaints against entries in the assessment book.\n",
      "From these provisions it is clear ' that the liabil ity for the tax is determined at the beginning of each official year and the tax is an annual one.\n",
      "It recurs from year to year.\n",
      "Sections 143to 168 concern themselves with the imposition, liability and assessment of the tax for the year.\n",
      "The amount of the tax for the year and the liability for its payment having been determined, the Act then pre scribes for its collection in the chapter \"The collection of taxes.\n",
      "\" Section 197 provides that each of the property taxes shall be payable in 559 advance  ...\n",
      "Summary: The charge created in respect of municipal property tax by section 212 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, is an \"annual charge not being a capital charge\" within the mean ing of section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act, 199.2, and the amount of such charge should therefore be deducted in computing the income from such property for the purposes of section 9 of the Indian Income tax Act.\n",
      "The charge in respect of urban immoveable property tax created by the Bombay Finance Act, 1939 is similar in character and the amount of such charge should also be deducted.\n",
      "The expression \"capital charge\" in s.9(1) (iv) means a charge created for a capital sum,that is to say, a charge created to. ' secure the discharge of a liability of a capi tal nature; and an \"annual charge\" means a charge to secure an annual liabili ty. 554\n",

      "The second defendant has preferred this appeal.\n",
      "The facts are not now in dispute and may be briefly stated.\n",
      "On 11th March, 1921, one Kumar Krishna Prasad Singh (hereinafter referred to as Kumar) granted a perma nent lease of the right to the underground coal in 5,800 bighas of land belonging to him to Shibsaran Singh and Sitaram Singh (hereinafter referred to as the Singhs) by a registered patta stipulating for a salami of Rs. 8,000 and royalty at the rate of 2a.\n",

      "By this document.\n",
      "835 the Deoshis agreed inter alia to pay royalty at the rate of 2a. per ton on all classes of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 750 a year.\n",
      "The Singhs feeling themselves aggrieved by the latter transaction brought a title suit (No. 1291 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhanbad for a declaration of their title and for possession of the 500 bighas leased to the Deoshis under the aforesaid patta of 7th June, 1921.\n",
      "To that suit Kumar was made a party as defendant No. 3, the Deoshis being defendants 1 and 2.\n",
      "The suit was however cornpromised on 6th March, 1923, by all the parties and a decree based on the compromise was also passed on the same day.\n",
      "The interest of the Singhs was brought to sale in 193S in execution of a decree obtained against them and was purchased by the plaintiff who insti tuted the presnt suit on 3rd October, 1942, claiming the royalty and cesses payable under the compromise decree for the period from Pous 1345 to Asadh 1349 B.S. from defendants 1 and 2 as the representatives of the Deoshis who entered into the compromise of March, 1923.\n",
      "In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties, it is necessary to set out the relevant terms of the compro mise decree which are as follows : \"The plaintiffs (the Singhs) within two months from this date shall pay Rs. 8,000 as salami to defendant No. 3 (Kumar).\n",
      "Otherwise all the terms of the compromise Will stand cancelled and the plaintiffs shall not be competent to claim any right to or possession over the.land covered by the patta dated 11th March, 1921.\n",
      "The patta which defend ant No. 3 executed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of 5,800 bighas of coal land in village Rahraband shall remain in force, and the plaintiffs will get a decree of declara tion of their right and title to the 500 bighas of coal land in dispute but defendants 1 and 2 (the Deoshis) shall hold possession as tenants.\n",
      "Besides the terms mentioned below, defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound by all the remaining terms under which they took settlement of the 500 bighas of coal land from defendant No. 3 under 836 patta and Kabuliyat, and both the defendants 1 and 2 shall possess the same under the plaintiffs from generation to generation and all the terms of the said patta and Kabuliyat shall remain effective and in force between them.\n",
      "Both the defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound to pay to the plain tiffs commission at the rate of 2a.\n",

      "per ton.\n",
      "In the new patta which defendant No. 3 will execute in favour of the plaintiffs he shall embody the condition that the annual minimum royalty will be Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 and commission will be at the rate of la. 9p.\n",

      "per ton with respect to 5,800 bighas and shall continue to realise commission at the rate of 2a. 6p. per ton from defendants 1 and 2 who shall remain bound to pay the same.\n",
      "\" 837 The answer to the question whether this compromise decree requires registration depends on the legal effect of the changes in the status quo ante of the parties brought about by the document.\n",
      "A careful analysis reveals the following alterations : (1) In the lease to the Singhs, the rate of royalty or commission was reduced from 2a.\n",
      "per ton of coal raised to la.\n",
      "per ton and the minimum royalty was reduced from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 6,000 while the area of coal land in their khas possession was reduced by 500 bighas. (2) In the lease to the Deoshis the rate of royalty or commission was enhanced from 2a.\n",
      "per ton to 2a.\n",
      "per ton and tiffs was made payable to the Singhs.\n",
      "The Singhs and the Deoshis were brought into a new legal relationship, the former accepting the latter as tenants holding the disputed 500 bighas under them in consideration of the latter agreeing to pay the enhanced royalty to the former. (4) The whole arrangement was made conditional on the Singhs paying Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months from the date of the compromise, it being expressly provided that the Singhs were not to be entitled to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed area of 503 bighas which evidently had not till then passed into their possession.\n",
      "Now, sub section (1) of section 17 of the , enumerates five categories of documents of which regis tration is made compulsory which include\" (d) leases of immoveable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent;\".\n",
      "Sub sec tion (2) however provided that \"nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub section (1)applies to . (vi) any decree or order of court.\n",
      "\" It may be mentioned in passing that this clause was amended with affect from the 1st April, 1930, by the , so as to exclude from the scope of the exception compromise decrees comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject matter of the suit.\n",
      "But 838 the amendment cannot affect the document here in question which came into existence in 1923.\n",
      "Before the amendment, the clause was held to cover even compromise decrees comprising immovable property which was not the subject matter of the suit: [Vide Hemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co. ( ')].\n",
      "That decision applies to the present case and obviates the objection that because the compromise in question covered also the remaining 5,300 bighas which were not the subject matter of the title suit of 1921, it was outside the scope of the exception in sub section (2), clause (vi).\n",
      "The only question, therefore, is whether the compromise decree is a \"lease\" [which expression includes \"an agreement to lease\" by the definition in section 2 (7)] within the meaning of el.\n",

      "It will be oh.served also that so far as the defendants were con cerned, their possession of the 500 bighas was not inter fered with and they still remained in possession as the lessees, but instead of paying the royalty to the plaintiffs it was agreed between all the parties that the defendants would pay the royalty in future to Shibsaran and Sitcram.\n",

      "Rameshwar Bhartia, the appellant, is a shopkeeper in Assam.\n",
      "He was prosecuted for storing paddy without a licence in excess of the quantity permitted by the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947.\n",
      "He admitted storage and possession of 550 maunds of paddy, but pleaded that he did not know that any licence was necessary.\n",
      "The 'Additional District Magistrate recorded a plea of guilty, but imposed him a fine of Rs. 50 only, as he considered his ignorance of the provisions of the Food Grains Control Order to be genuine.\n",
      "The stock of paddy was left in the possession of the appellant by the Procurement Inspector under a Jimmanama or security bond executed in his favour.\n",
      "He was subsequently unable to produce it before the court, as the whole of it was taken away by a Congress M.L.A. for affording relief to those who suffered in the earthquake, and so, the appellant was ordered to procure a similar quantity of paddy after taking an appropriate licence, and to make over the same to the procurement department payment of the price.\n",
      "The District Magistrate, being moved to do so by the procurement department, referred the case to the High Court under section 438, Criminal Procedure Code, for enhancement of the sentence, as in his opinion the sentence was unduly lenient and the Jimmanama, which was admittedly broken, should have been forfeited.\n",
      "128 The reference was accepted by the High Court, and the sent ence was enhanced to rigorous ' imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs. 1,000.\n",
      "As regards the Jimmanama, the case was sent back to the trial court for taking action according to law under section 514, Criminal Procedure Code, for its forfeiture.\n",
      "The appellant applied to the High.\n",
      "Court for a certificate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution that the case was a fit one for appeal to this Court.\n",
      "This application was granted.\n",
      "Out of the three points urged for the appellant, two were rejected, but the third one was accepted as a good ground, namely, that there was a contravention of the provisions of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code and that consequently the, trial before the Additional District Magistrate was void.\n",
      "One of the contentions urged before us was that Shri C.K. Bhuyan was not a \"Director\" at all and therefore there was no valid sanction under section 38 of the Order.\n",
      "A notifications dated 16th May) 1950, and published in the Assam Gazette of the 24th May, 1950, was produced before us to show that Sri C.K. Bhuyan was an Additional Deputy Commissioner and it was conceded by the appellant 's counsel before the High Court that if he was a Deputy Commissioner, he would be a Director under the Order, as all Deputy Commissioners in Assam were notified as Directors for the purposes of the Order.\n",
      "Mr. Jindra Lal sought to draw a distinction between a Deputy Commissioner and an Additional Deputy Commissioner in this respect, but there is no warrant for the same,, apart from the circumstance that it is a question of fact which has to be investigated afresh, and which we cannot allow to be raised now for the first time.\n",
      "The primary question to consider in this appeal is whether there has been any infringement of Section 556, Criminal Procedure Code, and a consequent want of jurisdiction in the court which tried the offence.\n",
      "The facts relevant to this question lie 129 within a narrow compass.\n",
      "The Procurement Inspector sent a report , Ist July,1950 about the nature of the offence ; he wrote out a short note the, subject, and requested that the accused might be prosecuted and the Assistant Director of Procurement, Dibru garh, might be authorised to dispose of the paddy immediately to avoid loss due to deterioration, Sri 0.\n",
      "K. Bhuyan,who was the then District Magistrate Lakhimpur, made the following order: \"Prosecution sanctioned under section 7 (1) of ,the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, for violation of sections 3 and 7 of the Assam Food Grains Oontrol Order, 1947.\n",
      "\" The case happened to be tried by the same gentleman in his capacity as Addtional District Magistrate, and the accused was convicted as aforesaid.\n",
      "The argument for the appellant was that having sanctioned the prosecution, Sri C.K. Bhuyan became \"personally interested\" in the case within the meaning of section 556, and was therefore incompetent to try the same.\n",
      "It was contended that the trial was not only irregular but illegal.\n",
      "There is no question that \"personal interest\" within the meaning of the section is not limited to private interest, and that it may well include official interest also.\n",
      "But what is the extent of the interest which will attract the disability is a subject which different views are possible and have been taken.\n",
      "Section 556 itself indicates the difficulty.\n",
      "The Explanation to the section runs in these terms: \"A Judge or Magistrate shall not be deemed a party, or personally interested, within the , meaning of this section, to or in any case by reason only that be is a Municipal Commissioner or otherwise concerned therein in a public capacity, or by reason only that he has viewed the place in which an offence, is alleged to have been committed, or any other place .in which any other transaction material to the case 'is alleged to have occurred, and made an inquiry III connection with the case.\n",
      "\" 130 This shows that to be connected with a case in a public capacity is not by itself enough to render the person incompetent to try it.\n",
      "Even if he had made an enquiry in connection with this case, it would not matter.\n",
      "But look at the illustration: \"A, as collector, upon consideration of information furnished to him, directs the prosecution of B for a breach of the excise laws.\n",
      "A is disqualified from trying this case as a Magistrate.\n",
      "\" It is evident from the words of the illustration that if a prosecution is directed by a person in one capacity, he shall not try the case acting in another capacity as a Magistrate.\n",
      "The explanation and illustration lend some support to the view that there is a distinction between a passive interest and an active interest, and that it is only in the latter case that the disqualification arises or intervenes.\n",
      "Under sub section (3) (a) of section 2 of the Assam Food Grains Control Order \"Director\" means \"the Director of Supply, Assam, and includes, for the purpose of any specific. provision of this Order, any other officer duly authorised in that behalf by him or by the Provincial Government by notification in the Official Gazette.\n",
      "\" Section 38 provides: No prosecution in respect of an alleged contravention of any provision of this Order shall be instituted without the sanction of the Director.\n",
      "\" A little confusion is likely to arise from the employment of the word \" Director\" in the Control Order and the word \"directs\" in the illustration to section 556 of the Code '.\n",
      "It has to be borne in mind that a sanction by the Director within the meaning of the Code does not necessarily mean \"a direction given by him that the accused should be prosecuted.\n",
      "\" In both cases of sanction and direction, an application of the mind is necessary, but there is this essential difference that in the one case there is a legal impediment to the prosecution if there be no sanction, and in the other case, there is a positive order that 131 the prosecution should be launched.\n",
      "For a sanction, all that is necessary for one to be satisfied about is the existence of a prima facie case.\n",
      "In the case of a, direction, a further element that the accused deserves to be prosecuted is involved.\n",
      "The question whether a Magistrate is personally interested or not has essentially to be decided the facts in each case.\n",
      "Pecuniary interest, however small, will be a disqualification but as regards other kinds of interest, there is no measure or standard except that it should be a substantial one, giving rise to a real bias, or a reasonable apprehension the part of the accused of such bias.\n",
      ", The maxim \" Nemo debet esse judex in propria sua causa\" applies only when the interest attributed is such as to render the case his own cause.\n",
      "The fulfllment of a technical requirement imposed by a statute may not, in many cases, amount to a mental satisfaction of the truth of the facts placed before the officer.\n",
      "Whether sanction should be granted or not may conceivably depend upon consideration extraneous to the merits of the case.\n",
      "But where a prosecution is directed, it means that the authority who gives the direction is satisfied in his own mind that the case must be initiated.\n",
      "Sanction is in the nature of a permission while a direction is in the nature of a command.\n",
      "Let us now examine some of the decisions the subject.\n",
      "For the appellant, strong reliance was placed the judgment of the Privy Council in Gokulchand Dwarkadas vs King(1), and it was argued the basis of some of the observations of the Judicial Committee that a sanction was an important and substantial matter and not a mere formality.\n",
      "The facts in that case were that while there was a sanction of the Government for a prosecution under the Cotton Cloth and Yarn Control, Order, there was nothing in the sanction itself, or in the shape of extraneous evidence, to show that the sanction was accorded after the relevant facts were placed before the sanctioning authority.\n",
      "To quote their Lordships ' own words; (1) (1948) 52 C.W.N.325.\n",
      "132 \"There is no evidence to show that the report of the Sub Inspector to the District Superintendent of Police, which was not put ...\n",
      "Summary: The question whether a Magistrate is \"personally interested\" in a ease within the meaning of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code, has essentially to be decided the facts of each case.\n",
      "Where an officer as a District Magistrate exercising his powers under section 7(1) of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, sanctioned the prosecution of a person for violation of sections 3 and 7 of the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947, and the same officer as Additional District Magistrate tried and convicted the accused, and it was contended that as the officer had given sanction for prosecution he was \"personally interested\" in the case within the meaning of section 656, Criminal Procedure Code, and the trial and conviction were therefore illegal: Held, that bymerely giving sanction for prosecution he did not become personally interested\" in the case and the trial and conviction were not illegal.\n",
      "In both cases of sanction and direction to prosecute, an application of the mind is necessary, but there is this essential difference that in the one case there is a legal impediment to the prosecution if there is no sanction and in the other case there is a positive order that the prosecution should be launched.\n",
      "For a sanction, all that is necessary for one to be satisfied about is the existence of a prima facie case.\n",
      "In the case of a direction, a further element that the accused deserves to be prosecuted is involved.\n",
      "Whether sanction should be granted or not may conceivably depend considerations extraneous to the merits of the case.\n",
      "But where a prosecution is directed, it means that the authority who gives the sanction is satisfied in his own mind that the case must be initiated.\n",
      "Sanction is in the nature of a permission, while direction is in the nature of a command.\n",

      "The Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM, J.\n",
      "This is an appeal from the judgment of the Nagpur High Court dismissing the appellants petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "The High Court certified under article 132(1) of the Constitution that the case involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.\n",
      "Hence the present appeal.\n",
      "The appellant was the Ruler of the State of Baster.\n",
      "After the passing of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the appellant executed an Instrument of Accession to the Dominion of India on August 14, 1947.\n",
      "Thereafter, he entered into an agreement with the Dominion of India popularly known as \"The Stand Still Agreement\".\n",
      "On December 15, 1947, he entered into an agreement with the Government of India whereby he ceded the State of Baster to the Government of India to be integrated with the Central Provinces and Berar (now the State of Madhya Pradesh) in such manner as the Government of India thought fit.\n",
      "Con sequently the Governments in India came to have exclusive and plenary authority, jurisdiction and powers over the Baster State with effect from January 1, 1948.\n",
      "The Legislature of the State of Madhya Pradesh passed the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 (Madhya Pradesh Act 1 of 1951), hereinafter referred to as the Act, which received the assent of the President of India on January 22, 1951.\n",
      "The preamble of the Act stated that it was one to provide for the acquisition of the rights of proprietors in estates, mahals, alienated villages and alienated lands in Madhya Pradesh and to make provisions for other matters connected therewith.\n",
      "Under section 3 of the Act, vesting of proprietary rights in the State Government takes place on certain conditions,, mentioned in that section, being complied with.\n",
      "The definition of 'proprietor ' is stated in section 2 cl.\n",
      "(m) and it is \"in relation to 503 (i) the Central Provinces, includes an inferior proprietor, a protected thekadar or other thekadar, or protected headman; (ii) the merged territories, means a maufidar including an ex Ruler of an Indian State merged with Madhya Pradesh, a Zamindar, Ilaquedar, Khorposhdar or Jagirdar within the meaning of wajib ul arz, or any sanad, deed or other instrument, and a gaontia or a thekadar of a village in respect of which by or under the provisions contained in the wajib ul arz applicable to such village the maufidar, the gaontia, or the thekadar, as the case may be, has a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village;\".\n",
      "The definition of 'mahal ' is stated in section 2(j) and it is \"mahal\", in relation to merged territories, means any area other than land in possession of a raiyat which has been separately assessed to land revenue, whether such land revenue be payable or has been released, compounded for or redeemed in whole or in part;\".\n",
      "Before the High Court the appellant contended that he was still a Sovereign Ruler and absolute owner of the villages specified in Schedules A and B of his petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.\n",
      "He urged that his rights had been recognized and guaranteed under the agreements entered into by him with the Government of India.\n",
      "The provisions of the Act, therefore, did not apply to him.\n",
      "It was further contended that the provisions of the Act did not apply to a Ruler or to the private property of a Ruler which was not assessed to land revenue.\n",
      "He relied on article 6 of the Instrument of Accession and the first paragraph of article 3 of the Merger Agreement.\n",
      "The High Court held that if the petitioner 's rights under article 6 of the Instrument of Accession and article 3 of the Merger Agreement had been infringed it was clear from the provisions of article 363 of the Constitution that interference by the courts was barred in disputes arising out of these two instruments.\n",
      "The High Court was also of the opinion that article 362 of the Constitu tion was of no assistance to the appellant.\n",
      "504 After referring to the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act, the High Court was of the opinion that the word 'maufidar ' in section 2(m) of the Act had not been used in any narrow or technical sense.\n",
      "A 'maufidar ' was not only a person to whom a grant of maufi lands had been made but was also one who held land which was exempt from the payment of \"rent or tax\".\n",
      "It accordingly rejected the contention on behalf of the appellant that the word 'maufidar ' is necessarily confined to a grantee from the State or Ruler and therefore a Ruler could not conceivably be a maufidar.\n",
      "The High Court also rejected the contention on behalf of the appellant that as he was a \"Ruler\" within the meaning of that expression in article 366(22) of the Constitution he did not come within the expression 'ex Ruler ' as contained in the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act.\n",
      "The expression 'Ruler ' as defined in article 366(22) of the Constitution applied only for interpreting the provisions of the Constitution.\n",
      "The expression 'ex Ruler ' given in the Act must therefore be given the ordinary dictionary meaning.\n",
      "According to Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 'Ruler ' means \"one who, or that which, exercises rule, especially of a supreme or sovereign kind.\n",
      "One who has control, management, or head ship within some limited sphere\".\n",
      "The High Court accordingly took the view that although the appellant did exercise such a rule in the past he ceased to exercise it in his former Domain after the agreements of accession and merger had come into operation.\n",
      "Accordingly the appellant must be regarded as an ex Ruler and as he was also a maufidar he fell within the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act.\n",
      "The question whether the villages mentioned in Schedules A and B of the petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution fell in any of the categories, \"Estates, Mahals, Alienated lands\", was also considered by the High Court.\n",
      "In its opinion they did not fall within the category of Estates or Alienated lands but they did fall within the category of Mahals.\n",
      "According to the definition of 'Mahal ' in section 2(j) of the Act the same must be separately assessed to land 505 revenue.\n",
      "According to the appellant they had not been assessed to land revenue but this was denied on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh.\n",
      "The High Court was of the opinion that in these circumstances it was for the appellant to establish that the villages in question had never been assessed to land revenue but no evidence had been led to this effect.\n",
      "On the contrary, according to the High Court, it would appear from the documents on the record that the villages known as 'Bhandar villages ' had been assessed to land revenue.\n",
      "As the rest of the villages in Schedule A and the villages in Schedule B, upto the date of the High Court judgment, had not been recognized as the private property of the appellant by the Government of India as required by the second and third paragraphs of the Merger Agreement, the appellant could not assert his ownership over them.\n",
      "The High Court, accordingly, dismissed his petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Two questions in the main were urged before us (1) whether the appellant is a proprietor within the meaning of that expression in the Act and (2) whether the villages in question came within the definition of the word 'mahal ' contained in the Act.\n",
      "On behalf of the appellant it had also been urged that the Act could not defeat the rights of the appellant guaranteed under article 3 of the Merger Agreement.\n",
      "It seems clear to us, however, that in view of the provisions of article 363(1) of the Constitution any dispute arising out of the Merger Agreement or the Instrument of Accession is beyond the competence of the courts to enquire into.\n",
      "The High Court rightly decided this point against the appellant.\n",
      "With reference to the first point we would first consider whether the appellant is an ex Ruler for the purposes of the Act.\n",
      "That he is so factually cannot be denied, since he ceded his State to the Government of India to be integrated with the Central Provinces and Berar (now the State of Madhya Pradesh) in such manner as the Government of India thought fit.\n",
      "He further ceded to the Government ' of India full and exclusive authority, jurisdiction and powers in relation 506 to the governance of his State when he agreed that the administration of that State would be transferred to the Government of India as from January 1, 1948.\n",
      "The question is whether his recognition for the purposes of the Constitution as Ruler by virtue of the provisions of article 366(22) of the Constitution of India continues his status as a Ruler for purposes other than the Constitution.\n",
      "article 366(22) states: \" \"Ruler\" in relation to an Indian State means the Prince, Chief or other person by whom any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause (1) of article 291 was entered into and who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Ruler of the State, and includes any person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the successor of such Ruler\".\n",
      "Article 291 refers to the privy purse payable to Rulers.\n",
      "It states: \"Where under any covenant or agreement entered into by the Ruler of any Indian State before the commencement of this Constitution, the payment of any sums, free of tax, has been guaranteed or assured by the Government of the Dominion of India to any Ruler of such State as privy purse (a) such sums shall be charged on, and paid out of, the Consolidated Fund of India; and (b) the sums so paid to any Ruler shall be exempt from all taxes on income.\n",
      "\" Article 291 refers to any covenant or agreement entered into by the Ruler of any Indian State before the commencement of the Constitution.\n",
      "The covenant or agreement referred to in this Article certainly includes the Instrument of Accession and the Merger Agreement.\n",
      "The effect of the Merger Agreement is clearly one by which factually a Ruler of an Indian State ceases to be a Ruler but for the purposes of the Constitution and for the purposes of the privy purse guaranteed, he is a Ruler as defined in article 366(22) of the Constitution.\n",
      "There is nothing in the provisions of article 366(22) which requires a court to recognise such a person as a Ruler for purposes outside the Constitution.\n",
      "In our opinion, the High Court rightly held that 507 the appellant was an ex Ruler and that article 366(22) of the Constitution did not make him a Ruler for the purposes of the Act.\n",
      "As the appellant was an 'ex Ruler ', he was within the class of persons who were by name specifically included in the definition of 'proprietor ' and therefore clearly within the scope of the Act.\n",
      "That the appellant was not only an ex Ruler but a maufidar appears to us to be clear.\n",
      "The ordinary dictionary meaning of maufi is \"Released, exempted, exempt from the payment of rent or tax, rent free\" and maufidar is \"A holder of rent free land, a grantee\".\n",
      "It was common ground in the High Court that the villages in question were exempt from the payment of rent or tax.\n",
      "In our opinion, the High Court rightly took the view that the expression 'maufidar ' was not necessarily confined to a grantee from a State or a Ruler of a State.\n",
      "A maufidar could be a person who was the holder of land which was exempted from the payment of rent or tax.\n",
      "In our opinion, the appellant certainly came within the expression 'maufidar ' besides being an ex Ruler ' of an Indian State merged with Madhya Pradesh.\n",
      "It is, however, contended on behalf of the appellant that the most important part of the definition was the concluding portion where it was stated that in the case of a maufidar he must be a person who by or under the provisions contained in the wajib ul arz applicable to his village, had the right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village.\n",
      "It was contended that even if the appellant was a maufidar, there was nothing to show that with reference to any village held by him it was entered in the wajib ul arz, that he had a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village.\n",
      "In the petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, filed by the appellant in the High Court, it was nowhere asserted that even if he was regarded as a maufidar it was not entered in the wajib ul arz with respect to any of his maufi villages that he had a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such villages.\n",
      "From the judgment of the High 508 Court it would appear that no such argument was advanced before it.\n",
      "In the application for a certificate under article 132(1) of the Constitution we can find no mention of this.\n",
      "In the statement of the case filed in this Court also there is no mention of this fact.\n",
      "There is thus no material on the record to establish that the appellant as a maufidar had no right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in his villages.\n",
      "The burden was on the appellant to prove this fact which he never attempted to discharge.\n",
      "It is impossible therefore to accept this contention on behalf of the appellant raised for the first time before us in the course of the submissions made on behalf of the appellant.\n",
      "Regarding the second point arising out of the definition of 'Mahal ', the High Court definitely found that the petitioner had given no evidence to establish that the villages in question were not assessed to land revenue.\n",
      "On the contrary, at least with reference to the Bhandar villages documents on the record showed that these villages had been assessed to land revenue.\n",
      "Since it was a question of fact whether the villages had been assessed to land revenue, which was denied on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh, the High Court rightly held that the contention of the appellant in this respect could not be accepted.\n",
      "As for the other villages, in Schedules A and B of the petition of the appellant under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution the High Court, in our opinion, rightly held that the petition was not maintainable as these villages had not yet been recognised by the Government of India as the private property of the appellant.\n",
      "In our opinion, the appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs.\n",
      "Appeal dismissed.\n",

      "this appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the high court of gujarat dated 28 2 1986 allowing the respondent 's writ petition and quashing order of discharge from service and directing his reinstatement in service.\n",
      "the respondent joined service as technical assistant with the gujarat state electricity board hereinafter refined to as the board he was promoted to the post of deputy engineer.\n",
      "while he was posted at surat as deputy engineer he was transferred to ukai subdivision under the order of the superintending engineer dated 29th march1974 pursuant to the order of transfer he was relieved from his duties at surat on 30th march1974 to enable him to join at ukai.\n",
      "he made representation to the additional chief engineer for cancelling his transfer order on the ground that his mother aged 70 years was ailing and it would cause great inconvenience to him if he was required to join at ukai.\n",
      "his representation was rejected and he was directed to join at ukai but he did not do so instead he filed a civil suit at baroda challenging validity of the order of transfer.\n",
      "meanwhile the chief engineer by his order dated 27th may1974 discharged the respondent from service with effect from 31st march1974 in accordance with service regulation no 113 the respondent challenged the validity of the order of his discharge from service by means of a writ petition under article 226 of the constitution before the high court of gujarat.\n",
      "a learned single judge of the high court quashed the order of termination on the findings that the order of discharge was issued m violation of the basic principles of natural justice as no opportunity was afforded to the respondent before discharging him from services under regulation no 113.\n",
      "the learned single judge granted a declaration in respondent 's favour holding the order void and illegal but having regard to recalcitrant attitude of the appellant and his continued conduct of disobedience of the orders of his superior authorities he refused to grant consequential reliefs regarding reinstatement or payment of back wages.\n",
      "the respondent as well as the appellant board both preferred letters patent appeals against the order of learned single judge.\n",
      "a division bench of the high court dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellants but it allowed the respondent 's appeal.\n",
      "the division bench upheld the order of the learned single judge holding the order of discharge illegal and void but it set aside the order of the learned single judge refusing to grant consequential relief instead it directed the appellants to reinstate the respondent and to treat him in service without any break in service and to grant him benefits of increments seniority and promotion to which he may be entitled under the rules.\n",
      "the bench however did not grant full back wages to the respondent instead it directed the board to pay him 50 per cent of back wages.\n",
      "aggrieved the appellant has preferred the instant appeal after obtaining special leave of this court.\n",

      "after hearing learned counsel for the parties we were satisfied that the learned single judge as well as the division bench both had committed error in allowing the writ petition and granting relief to the respondent.\n",
      "we expressed our view in the court and suggested to mr vimal dave counsel for the respondent that if he agreed the original writ petition of the respondent could be dismissed without directing him to refund the amount which he had already been paid by the appellants in pursuance to the orders of the high court and of this court as during the pendency of the appeal.\n",

      "the appeal came up for hearing before us on 16 2 1988 when another counsel appeared to argue the appeal on behalf of the respondent on merits.\n",
      "we refused to hear the counsel as we had already completed hearing.\n",
      "thereupon the respondent himself appeared in person and sought permission to make his submissions personally.\n",
      "we refused to accede to his request as oral heating had already been completed and the matter had been adjourned only to enable the respondent 's counsel to obtain instructions.\n",
      "however in the interest of justice we permitted the respondent to file written submissions if any in support of his case.\n",
      "thereafter the case was listed several times but no written submissions were filed instead the respondent adopted an unusual course by sending an application by post expressing his no confidence in us with a prayer to transfer the case to some other bench.\n",
      "since this was unusual uncalled for and unjustified request we ignored the same and reserved the order.\n",
      "we are constrained to note that instead of utilizing the opportunity granted to him for filing written submissions the respondent has misused adjournments for the purposes of raising frivolous objections for getting the case transferred to some other bench.\n",
      "no party is entitled to get a case transferred from one bench to the other unless the bench is biased or there are some reasonable grounds for the same but no right to get a case transferred to any other bench can legitimately be claimed merely because the judges express opinion on the merits of the case on the conclusion of hearing.\n",
      "in the instant case on the conclusion of the oral hearing we had expressed our opinion on 28 1 1988 in the open court that we were inclined to allow the appeal and set aside the order of the high court and dismiss the writ petition but taking a sympathetic view we requested sh.\n",

      "the opportunity granted to the respondent has however been misused by raising mischievous and frivolous objections instead of filing written submissions.\n",

      "transfer of a government servant appointed to a particular cadre of transferable posts from one place to the other is an incident of service.\n",
      "no government servant or employee of public undertaking has legal tight for being posted at any particular place.\n",
      "transfer from one place to other is generally a condition of service and the employee has no choice in the matter.\n",
      "transfer from one place to other is necessary in public interest and efficiency in the public administration.\n",

      "if the order of transfer is not stayed modified or cancelled the concerned public servant must carry out the order of transfer.\n",
      "in the absence of any stay of the transfer order a public servant has no justification to avoid or evade the transfer order merely on the ground of having made a representation or on the ground of his difficulty in moving from one place to the other.\n",
      "if he fails to proceed on transfer in compliance to the transfer order he would expose himself to disciplinary action under the relevant rules as has happened in the instant case.\n",
      "the respondent lost his service as he refused to comply with the order of his transfer from one place to the other.\n",
      "there is no dispute that the respondent was holding a transferable post and under the conditions of service applicable to him he was liable to be transferred and posted at any place within the state of gujarat.\n",
      "the respondent had no legal or statutory right to insist for being posted at one particular place.\n",
      "in fact during the tenure of his service in the board the respondent had been transferred from one place to another place several times.\n",

      "chief engineer who discharged the respondent 's services exercised his power under service regulation no 113which runs as under 113 the continued absence from duty or overstay m spite of warning to return to duty shall render the employee liable to summarily discharge from service without the necessity of proceedings under the gujarat electricity board conduct discipline and appeal procedure.\n",
      "the above rule provides that if an employee of the gujarat electricity board continues to remain absent from duty or overstays the period of sanctioned leave and in spite of warning he fails to return to duty he renders himself liable to be discharged summarily from service without complying with the procedure prescribed for taking disciplinary action under the gujarat electricity board conduct discipline and appeal procedure.\n",
      "regulation 113 confers wide powers on the authorities to summarily discharge an employee from service if he continues to be absent from duty in an unauthorised manner and refuses to join his duty even after warning.\n",
      "under the disciplinary rules detailed procedure is required to be followed for removing an employee from service but regulation 113 provides for summary discharge from service.\n",
      "before this power is exercised two conditions must be satisfied firstly the employee must be found to be absent from duty without leave or overstaying the period of sanctioned leave and secondly he failed to join his duty even after a warning.\n",
      "the object and purpose of giving warning is to remind the delinquent employee that if he continues to be absent from duty he would be liable to action under regulation 113 and to afford him an opportunity to make amends by joining his duty.\n",
      "if even thereafter he fails to join duty his services are liable to be terminated by an order of discharge.\n",
      "it is noteworthy that the validity of regulation 113 was not challenged before the high court and the parties proceeded on the assumption that regulation 113 was valid and applicable to the respondent 's service.\n",

      "march 301974 to may 271974.\n",
      "the division bench of the high court held that no warning as contemplated by service regulation no 113 had been issued to the respondent nor he had been afforded any opportunity of showing cause before the impugned order of discharge was passed and consequently the order of discharge was null and void being contrary to service regulation no 113 itself.\n",
      "on perusal of the material on record we are of the opinion that the view taken by the high court is not sustainable as there is sufficient material on record which shows that warning had been issued to the respondent before the order of discharge was issued.\n",
      "in determining the question whether any warning was given to the respondent it is necessary to refer to the sequence of events and the correspondence which ensued between the appellants and the respondent.\n",
      "on march 291974 the superintending engineer of the board issued the order transferring the respondent from surat to ukai on 30 3 1974 the respondent was relieved from surat and directed to join his duty at ukai but the respondent did not join his duty at the new place of posting.\n",
      "instead he made a representation to the additional chief engineer on 8 4 1974 after the transfer order.\n",

      "by that letter respondent stated that he was waiting for the decision of his representation made for reconsideration of his transfer from surat to ukai and therefore the question of his remaining on unauthorised leave was misconceived.\n",

      "no government servant or employee of any public undertaking has a right to be absent from duty without sanction of leave merely on account of pendency of representation against the order of transfer.\n",
      "since the respondent continued to be absent from duty the superintending engineer by a registered post acknowledgment due letter dated april 241974 informed the respondent that his request to postpone his transfer was rejected and he was directed to join his duty at ukai and on his failure to do so disciplinary action would be taken against him.\n",

      "ultimately the chief engineer of the board took action against the respondent and discharged him from service with effect from 31 3 1974 by his letter dated may 271974.\n",
      "the sequence of events and the correspondence which ensued between the officers of the board and the respondent clearly show that the respondent disobeyed the order of transfer and he remained absent from duty in an unauthorised manner without obtaining sanction of leave.\n",
      "the aforesaid documents leave no room for any doubt that the respondent was reminded of his failure to join his duties at ukai and he was further reminded that his unauthorised absence had exposed him to disciplinary action.\n",
      "in fact the superintending engineer had by his letter dated 18th april1974 clearly reminded the respondent that his unauthorised absence was in breach of service regulation no 113 and called upon to show cause why action should not be taken against him but in spite of these letters the respondent failed to join his duties.\n",
      "the division bench of the high court has held that since no warning was issued to the respondent action taken under service regulation no 113 was not in accordance with law.\n",
      "this finding is wholly misconceived.\n",
      "a warning need not be in any particular form.\n",
      "the object and purpose of the warning as contemplated by the regulation is to remind the delinquent employee that his continued unauthorised absence from duties was liable to result in discharge of his service.\n",
      "the substance of the superintending engineer 's letter dated 18th april1974 which was admittedly served on the respondent contained warning to the respondent which fully met the requirement of regulation no 113.\n",
      "before the high court a controversy was raised as to whether the registered letter dated 24 4 1974 addressed by the superintending engineer to the respondent was received by him or not.\n",
      "the registered cover containing the letter dated 24 4 1974 was returned back by the postal authorities with an endorsement that the addressee refused to accept the same.\n",
      "the respondent 's case was that no such registered letter was tendered to him by the postman nor he ever refused to accept the same.\n",
      "the division bench held that letter dated 24 4 1974 which contained a warning had not been served on the respondent and since the board had failed to raise the question before the learned single judge it could not do so in the letters patent appeal.\n",
      "the division bench further held that since the letter dated 24 4 1974 was not served on the respondent there was no material to show that any warning had been issued to the respondent before he was discharged from service.\n",
      "we do not agree with the view taken by the division bench.\n",
      "firstly even if the letter dated 24 4 1974 was not served on the respondent there is no dispute that the superintending engineer 's letter dated 18th april1974 had been served on him.\n",
      "by that letter warning as contemplated by regulation no 113 had been issued to the respondent.\n",
      "therefore even if the letter dated 24 4 1974 was not served on the respondent the order of discharge as contemplated by regulation no 113 is sustainable in law.\n",
      "but even otherwise the division bench committed error in holding that the board had raised the question of service of the letter dated 24 4 1974 for the first time before the division bench in the letters patent appeal.\n",
      "perusal of the averments made in paragraphs 171823 and 25 2ii of the counter affidavit filed in reply to the petitioner 's writ petition before the learned single judge shows that the board had categorically pleaded that the respondent was informed by letter dated 24 4 1974 that his representation to postpone his transfer was rejected and he should obey the order of transfer.\n",
      "it was further pleaded that the respondent had refused to accept the registered letter and the same had been returned back by the postal authorities with an endorsement that the addressee refused to accept the same.\n",
      "in his rejoinder affidavit the respondent denied the aforesaid allegations and asserted that the letter was not tendered to him and he never refused to accept the registered cover and the postal endorsement was wrong and incorrect.\n",
      "apart from denying the postal endorsement the respondent placed no material before the court in support of his pleading.\n",
      "in this view we are of the opinion that the division bench was totally wrong in holding that no opportunity was afforded to the respondent to meet the case set up by the board that the letter dated 24 4 1974 was served on the respondent.\n",
      "no new plea had been raised by the board before the division bench instead the plea relating to service of the aforesaid letter had already been before the learned single judge.\n",
      "there is presumption of service of a letter sent under registered cover if the same is returned back with a postal endorsement that the addressee refused to accept the same.\n",
      "no doubt the presumption is rebuttable and it is open to the party concerned to place evidence before the court to rebut the presumption by showing that the address mentioned on the cover was incorrect or that the postal authorities never tendered the registered letter to him or that there was no occasion for him to refuse the same.\n",
      "the burden to rebut the presumption lies on the party challenging the factum of service.\n",
      "in the instant case the respondent failed to discharge this burden as he failed to place material before the court to show that the endorsement made by the postal authorities was wrong and incorrect.\n",
      "mere denial made by the respondent in the circumstances of the case was not sufficient to rebut the presumption relating to service of the registered cover.\n",
      "we are therefore of the opinion that the letter dated 24 4 1974 was served on the respondent and he refused to accept the same.\n",
      "consequently the service was complete and the view taken by the high court is incorrect.\n",
      "in view of the above discussion we therefore hold that the respondent 's failure to join his duties at ukai resulted in unauthorised absence and his failure to join his duties in spite of the repeated reminders and letters issued to him constituted sufficient valid ground for taking action under regulation no 113 we further hold that before issuing the order of discharge the respondent was not only warned but he was also afforded an opportunity to explain as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against him.\n",
      "the respondent acted in an irresponsible manner in not complying with the order of transfer which led to his discharge from service in accordance with the service regulation.\n",
      "no 113 the learned single judge as well as the division bench both erred in law in setting aside the order of discharge.\n",
      "we accordingly allow the appeal set aside the order of the single judge as well as division bench and dismiss the respondent 's petition.\n",
      "there would be no order as to costs.\n",

      "The High Court certified under article 132(1) of the Constitution that the case involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.\n",
      "Hence the present appeal.\n",
      "The appellant was the Ruler of the State of Baster.\n",
      "After the passing of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the appellant executed an Instrument of Accession to the Dominion of India on August 14, 1947.\n",
      "Thereafter, he entered into an agreement with the Dominion of India popularly known as \"The Stand Still Agreement\".\n",
      "On December 15, 1947, he entered into an agreement with the Government of India whereby he ceded the State of Baster to the Government of India to be integrated with the Central Provinces and Berar (now the State of Madhya Pradesh) in such manner as the Government of India thought fit.\n",
      "Con sequently the Governments in India came to have exclusive and plenary authority, jurisdiction and powers over the Baster State with effect from January 1, 1948.\n",
      "The Legislature of the State of Madhya Pradesh passed the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 (Madhya Pradesh Act 1 of 1951), hereinafter referred to as the Act, which received the assent of the President of India on January 22, 1951.\n",
      "The preamble of the Act stated that it was one to provide for the acquisition of the rights of proprietors in estates, mahals, alienated villages and alienated lands in Madhya Pradesh and to make provisions for other matters connected therewith.\n",
      "Under section 3 of the Act, vesting of proprietary rights in the State Government takes place on certain conditions,, mentioned in that section, being complied with.\n",
      "The definition of 'proprietor ' is stated in section 2 cl.\n",
      "(m) and it is \"in relation to 503 (i) the Central Provinces, includes an inferior proprietor, a protected thekadar or other thekadar, or protected headman; (ii) the merged territories, means a maufidar including an ex Ruler of an Indian State merged with Madhya Pradesh, a Zamindar, Ilaquedar, Khorposhdar or Jagirdar within the meaning of wajib ul arz, or any sanad, deed or other instrument, and a gaontia or a thekadar of a village in respect of which by or under the provisions contained in the wajib ul arz applicable to such village the maufidar, the gaontia, or the thekadar, as the case may be, has a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village;\".\n",
      "The definition of 'mahal ' is stated in section 2(j) and it is \"mahal\", in relation to merged territories, means any area other than land in possession of a raiyat which has been separately assessed to land revenue, whether such land revenue be payable or has been released, compounded for or redeemed in whole or in part;\".\n",
      "Before the High Court the appellant contended that he was still a Sovereign Ruler and absolute owner of the villages specified in Schedules A and B of his petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.\n",
      "He urged that his rights had been recognized and guaranteed under the agreements entered into by him with the Government of India.\n",
      "The provisions of the Act, therefore, did not apply to him.\n",
      "It was further contended that the provisions of the Act did not apply to a Ruler or to the private property of a Ruler which was not assessed to land revenue.\n",
      "He relied on article 6 of the Instrument of Accession and the first paragraph of article 3 of the Merger Agreement.\n",
      "The High Court held that if the petitioner 's rights under article 6 of the Instrument of Accession and article 3 of the Merger Agreement had been infringed it was clear from the provisions of article 363 of the Constitution that interference by the courts was barred in disputes arising out of these two instruments.\n",
      "The High Court was also of the opinion that article 362 of the Constitu tion was of no assistance to the appellant.\n",
      "504 After referring to the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act, the High Court was of the opinion that the word 'maufidar ' in section 2(m) of the Act had not been used in any narrow or technical sense.\n",
      "A 'maufidar ' was not only a person to whom a grant of maufi lands had been made but was also one who held land which was exempt from the payment of \"rent or tax\".\n",
      "It accordingly rejected the contention on behalf of the appellant that the word 'maufidar ' is necessarily confined to a grantee from the State or Ruler and therefore a Ruler could not conceivably be a maufidar.\n",
      "The High Court also rejected the contention on behalf of the appellant that as he was a \"Ruler\" within the meaning of that expression in article 366(22) of the Constitution he did not come within the expression 'ex Ruler ' as contained in the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act.\n",
      "The expression 'Ruler ' as defined in article 366(22) of the Constitution applied only for interpreting the provisions of the Constitution.\n",
      "The expression 'ex Ruler ' given in the Act must therefore be given the ordinary dictionary meaning.\n",
      "According to Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 'Ruler ' means \"one who, or that which, exercises rule, especially of a supreme or sovereign kind.\n",
      "One who has control, management, or head ship within some limited sphere\".\n",
      "The High Court accordingly took the view that although the appellant did exercise such a rule in the past he ceased to exercise it in his former Domain after the agreements of accession and merger had come into operation.\n",
      "Accordingly the appellant must be regarded as an ex Ruler and as he was also a maufidar he fell within the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act.\n",
      "The question whether the villages mentioned in Schedules A and B of the petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution fell in any of the categories, \"Estates, Mahals, Alienated lands\", was also considered by the High Court.\n",
      "In its opinion they did not fall within the category of Estates or Alienated lands but they did fall within the category of Mahals.\n",
      "According to the definition of 'Mahal ' in section 2(j) of the Act the same must be separately assessed to land 505 revenue.\n",
      "According to the appellant they had not been assessed to land revenue but this was denied on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh.\n",
      "The High Court was of the opinion that in these circumstances it was for the appellant to establish that the villages in question had never been assessed to land revenue but no evidence had been led to this effect.\n",
      "On the contrary, according to the High Court, it would appear from the documents on the record that the villages known as 'Bhandar villages ' had been assessed to land revenue.\n",
      "As the rest of the villages in Schedule A and the villages in Schedule B, upto the date of the High Court judgment, had not been recognized as the private property of the appellant by the Government of India as required by the second and third paragraphs of the Merger Agreement, the appellant could not assert his ownership over them.\n",
      "The High Court, accordingly, dismissed his petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Two questions in the main were urged before us (1) whether the appellant is a proprietor within the meaning of that expression in the Act and (2) whether the villages in question came within the definition of the word 'mahal ' contained in the Act.\n",
      "On behalf of the appellant it had also been urged that the Act could not defeat the rights of the appellant guaranteed under article 3 of the Merger Agreement.\n",
      "It seems clear to us, however, that in view of the provisions of article 363(1) of the Constitution any dispute arising out of the Merger Agreement or the Instrument of Accession is beyond the competence of the courts to enquire into.\n",
      "The High Court rightly decided this point against the appellant.\n",
      "With reference to the first point we would first consider whether the appellant is an ex Ruler for the purposes of the Act.\n",
      "That he is so factually cannot be denied, since he ceded his State to the Government of India to be integrated with the Central Provinces and Berar (now the State of Madhya Pradesh) in such manner as the Government of India thought fit.\n",
      "He further ceded to the Government ' of India full and exclusive authority, jurisdiction and powers in relation 506 to the governance of his State when he agreed that the administration of that State would be transferred to the Government of India as from January 1, 1948.\n",
      "The question is whether his recognition for the purposes of the Constitution as Ruler by virtue of the provisions of article 366(22) of the Constitution of India continues his status as a Ruler for purposes other than the Constitution.\n",
      "article 366(22) states: \" \"Ruler\" in relation to an Indian State means the Prince, Chief or other person by whom any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause (1) of article 291 was entered into and who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Ruler of the State, and includes any person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the successor of such Ruler\".\n",
      "Article 291 refers to the privy purse payable to Rulers.\n",
      "It states: \"Where under any covenant or agreement entered into by the Ruler of any Indian State before the commencement of this Constitution, the payment of any sums, free of tax, has been guaranteed or assured by the Government of the Dominion of India to any Ruler of such State as privy purse (a) such sums shall be charged on, and paid out of, the Consolidated Fund of India; and (b) the sums so paid to any Ruler shall be exempt from all taxes on income.\n",
      "\" Article 291 refers to any covenant or agreement entered into by the Ruler of any Indian State before the commencement of the Constitution.\n",
      "The covenant or agreement referred to in this Article certainly includes the Instrument of Accession and the Merger Agreement.\n",
      "The effect of the Merger Agreement is clearly one by which factually a Ruler of an Indian State ceases to be a Ruler but for the purposes of the Constitution and for the purposes of the privy purse guaranteed, he is a Ruler as defined in article 366(22) of the Constitution.\n",
      "There is nothing in the provisions of article 366(22) which requires a court to recognise such a person as a Ruler for purposes outside the Constitution.\n",
      "In our opinion, the High Court rightly held that 507 the appellant was an ex Ruler and that article 366(22) of the Constitution did not make him a Ruler for the purposes of the Act.\n",
      "As the appellant was an 'ex Ruler ', he was within the class of persons who were by name specifically included in the definition of 'proprietor ' and therefore clearly within the scope of the Act.\n",
      "That the appellant was not only an ex Ruler but a maufidar appears to us to be clear.\n",
      "The ordinary dictionary meaning of maufi is \"Released, exempted, exempt from the payment of rent or tax, rent free\" and maufidar is \"A holder of rent free land, a grantee\".\n",
      "It was common ground in the High Court that the villages in question were exempt from the payment of rent or tax.\n",
      "In our opinion, the High Court rightly took the view that the expression 'maufidar ' was not necessarily confined to a grantee from a State or a Ruler of a State.\n",
      "A maufidar could be a person who was the holder of land which was exempted from the payment of rent or tax.\n",
      "In our opinion, the appellant certainly came within the expression 'maufidar ' besides being an ex Ruler ' of an Indian State merged with Madhya Pradesh.\n",
      "It is, however, contended on behalf of the appellant that the most important part of the definition was the concluding portion where it was stated that in the case of a maufidar he must be a person who by or under the provisions contained in the wajib ul arz applicable to his village, had the right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village.\n",
      "It was contended that even if the appellant was a maufidar, there was nothing to show that with reference to any village held by him it was entered in the wajib ul arz, that he had a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village.\n",
      "In the petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, filed by the appellant in the High Court, it was nowhere asserted that even if he was regarded as a maufidar it was not entered in the wajib ul arz with respect to any of his maufi villages that he had a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such villages.\n",
      "From the judgment of the High 508 Court it would appear that no such argument was advanced before it.\n",
      "In the application for a certificate under article 132(1) of the Constitution we can find no mention of this.\n",
      "In the statement of the case filed in this Court also there is no mention of this fact.\n",
      "There is thus no material on the record to establish that the appellant as a maufidar had no right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in his villages.\n",
      "The burden was on the appellant to prove this fact which he never attempted to discharge.\n",
      "It is impossible therefore to accept this contention on behalf of the appellant raised for the first time before us in the course of the submissions made on behalf of the appellant.\n",
      "Regarding the second point arising out of the definition of 'Mahal ', the High Court definitely found that the petitioner had given no evidence to establish that the villages in question were not assessed to land revenue.\n",
      "On the contrary, at least with reference to the Bhandar villages documents on the record showed that these villages had been assessed to land revenue.\n",
      "Since it was a question of fact whether the villages had been assessed to land revenue, which was denied on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh, the High Court rightly held that the contention of the appellant in this respect could not be accepted.\n",
      "As for the other villages, in Schedules A and B of the petition of the appellant under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution the High Court, in our opinion, rightly held that the petition was not maintainable as these villages had not yet been recognised by the Government of India as the private property of the appellant.\n",
      "In our opinion, the appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs.\n",
      "Appeal dismissed. [/INST] The appellant was the Ruler of the State of Baster which was later integrated with the State of Madhya Pradesh.\n",
      "He was recognised by the President as a Ruler under article 366(22) of the Constitution.\n",
      "The respondent resumed certain lands belonging to the appellant under the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950.\n",
      "The appellant contended that he was still a Ruler and not an ex Ruler and as such did not come within the definition of \"proprietor\" given in the Act.\n",
      "Held, that the appellant was an ex Ruler for the purposes of the Act and was within the class of persons who were by name included in the definition of 'proprietor ' and was within the scope of the Act.\n",
      "Factually the appellant was an ex Ruler.\n",
      "He was a Ruler for the purposes of the privy purse guaranteed to him.\n",
      "There was nothing in article 366(22) which required a court to treat such a person as a Ruler for purposes outside the Constitution.\n",
      "Further, the appellant was also a maufidar in respect of the lands acquired which were exempt from the payment of rent or tax.\n",
      "The expression \"maufidar\" was not necessarily confined to a grantee from a State or a Ruler of a State; he could be the holder of land which was exempted from payment of rent or tax. </s>\n",
